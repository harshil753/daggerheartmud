            **[DESCRIPTION]**: The common room of the Sleeping Bear Inn is filled with the warm glow of a central hearth. The air smells of roasted meat and spilled ale. Sturdy wooden tables are scattered across the floorboards. Behind a long wooden counter, the innkeeper Maeve polishes a mug. A staircase to the north leads up to the rooms.

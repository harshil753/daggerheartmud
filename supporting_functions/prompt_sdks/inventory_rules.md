# Inventory Rules - Daggerheart

## Inventory Overview

Inventory management in Daggerheart is designed to be simple and narrative-focused, allowing players to carry what makes sense for their character without getting bogged down in detailed encumbrance rules.

## Carrying Capacity

### Basic Rules
- Characters can carry a reasonable amount of equipment and items
- The GM determines if a character is carrying too much
- Common sense applies to what can be carried

### Inventory Tracking
- **Active Equipment**: Currently equipped weapons and armor
- **Inventory Weapons**: Up to 2 additional weapons
- **General Inventory**: Other items, consumables, and equipment
- **Domain Cards**: Loadout and vault system

## Equipment Categories

### Active Equipment
Your equipped weapons and armor are the ones listed in the "Active Weapons" and "Active Armor" sections of your character sheet. Your character can only attack with weapons, benefit from armor, and gain features from items they have equipped.

#### Active Weapons
- **Primary Weapon**: One primary weapon equipped
- **Secondary Weapon**: One secondary weapon equipped
- **Features**: Only active weapons provide their features

#### Active Armor
- **One Armor**: Characters can only have one Active Armor at a time
- **Armor Slots**: Each armor has its own Armor Slots
- **Protection**: Only active armor provides protection

### Inventory Weapons
PCs can carry up to two additional weapons in the "Inventory Weapon" areas of the character sheet.

**Rules for Inventory Weapons**:
- Features from inventory weapons are not usable
- Can be swapped with active weapons
- Must be of the same burden to swap freely

### General Inventory
This is where you store all of your items and consumables. Items in general inventory include:
- **Consumables**: Potions, scrolls, food, etc.
- **Tools**: Equipment for specific tasks

## Equipment Management

### Swapping Weapons
You can swap an Inventory Weapon with an Active Weapon of the same burden:
- **During Rest**: No cost
- **During Calm**: No cost
- **Under Pressure**: Must mark 1 Stress

### Equipping Armor
- **Safe Conditions**: Can equip or unequip armor without cost
- **Dangerous Conditions**: Cannot equip armor while in danger or under pressure
- **Recalculation**: When equipping/unequipping armor, recalculate damage thresholds

### Armor Slots
Each armor has its own Armor Slots. If your character unequips their armor, track how many of its Armor Slots are marked. You can't carry armor in your inventory.

## Domain Cards

### Loadout System
Domain cards are organized in a loadout system:
- **Loadout**: Active domain cards (limited capacity)

- **Swapping**: Can move cards between loadout and vault

### Loadout Rules

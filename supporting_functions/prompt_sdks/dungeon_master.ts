### Action Resolution System

**Non-Story Actions:**
When players attempt actions that don't directly progress the main story:
- **Allow the attempt** - Don't block player agency
- **Apply appropriate difficulty** based on the action
- **Use Hope/Fear dice results** to determine outcomes
- **Provide meaningful consequences** based on results

**Hope/Fear Dice Outcomes:**

**SUCCESS WITH HOPE (Hope die higher):**
- **Best possible outcome** - Action succeeds perfectly
- **Bonus benefits** - Extra information, resources, or advantages
- **Story hints** - Subtle guidance toward story progression
- **Positive consequences** - NPCs become more friendly, new opportunities open

**SUCCESS WITH FEAR (Fear die higher):**
- **Good outcome** with minor consequence
- **Action succeeds** but with a cost or complication
- **Mixed results** - Success but something goes wrong
- **Warning signs** - Hints that this path may be dangerous

**FAILURE WITH HOPE (Hope die higher):**
- **No progression** but no negative consequences
- **Neutral result** - Nothing happens, no harm done
- **Gentle guidance** - Subtle hints toward better actions
- **Maintain player agency** - No punishment for trying

**FAILURE WITH FEAR (Fear die higher):**
- **Negative consequences** and no story progression
- **Punishment appropriate** to the action attempted
- **Setbacks** - Lost resources, damaged relationships, or complications
- **Learning opportunity** - Clear indication this approach won't work

**Example Responses:**

**Success with Hope:**
\`\`\`
[ACTION_RESULT: SUCCESS_WITH_HOPE]
[OUTCOME: You successfully pick the lock and find a hidden compartment 
containing a map to the ancient ruins. The lock mechanism was surprisingly 
well-maintained, suggesting recent use.]

[BONUS: You also notice the lock was recently oiled - someone has been here recently.]

[HINT: The map shows a path through the Whispering Woods that might lead 
to the artifact you're seeking.]

[PROMPT: What would you like to do?]
\`\`\`

**Success with Fear:**
\`\`\`
[ACTION_RESULT: SUCCESS_WITH_FEAR]
[OUTCOME: You successfully pick the lock, but the mechanism was booby-trapped. 
You find the hidden compartment with a map, but you've triggered an alarm.]

[CONSEQUENCE: You hear footsteps approaching from the corridor outside.]

[PROMPT: What would you like to do?]
\`\`\`

**Failure with Hope:**
\`\`\`
[ACTION_RESULT: FAILURE_WITH_HOPE]
[OUTCOME: The lock proves too complex for your current tools, but you don't 
damage anything in the attempt.]

[HINT: Perhaps you could find better lockpicks, or look for another way in.]

[PROMPT: What would you like to do?]
\`\`\`

**Failure with Fear:**
\`\`\`
[ACTION_RESULT: FAILURE_WITH_FEAR]
[OUTCOME: Your lockpicks break in the mechanism, and you've made a loud 
noise that echoes through the corridor.]

[CONSEQUENCE: You hear multiple sets of footsteps approaching rapidly.]

[PUNISHMENT: You've lost your lockpicks and alerted the guards.]

[PROMPT: What would you like to do?]

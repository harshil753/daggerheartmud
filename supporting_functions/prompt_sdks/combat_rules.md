# Combat Rules - Daggerheart

## Combat Overview

Though Daggerheart relies on the same flow of collaborative storytelling in and out of combat, physical conflicts rely more heavily on several key mechanics related to attacking, maneuvering, and taking damage.

## Core Combat Mechanics

### Evasion
Evasion represents a character's ability to avoid attacks and other unwanted effects. Any roll made against a PC has a Difficulty equal to the target's Evasion. A PC's base Evasion is determined by their class, but can be modified by domain cards, equipment, conditions, and other effects.

**Note**: Attacks rolled against adversaries use the target's Difficulty instead of Evasion.

### Hit Points & Damage Thresholds

Hit Points (HP) represent a character's ability to withstand physical injury. When a character takes damage, they mark 1 to 3 HP, based on their damage thresholds:

- **Severe Damage**: If the final damage is at or above the character's Severe damage threshold, they mark **3 HP**
- **Major Damage**: If the final damage is at or above the character's Major damage threshold but below their Severe damage threshold, they mark **2 HP**
- **Minor Damage**: If the final damage is below the character's Major damage threshold, they mark **1 HP**
- **No Damage**: If incoming damage is ever reduced to 0 or less, no HP is marked

A PC's damage thresholds are calculated by adding their level to the listed damage thresholds of their equipped armor.

### Stress System

Stress represents how much mental, physical, and emotional strain a character can endure. Some special abilities or effects require the character activating them to mark Stress, and the GM can require a PC to mark Stress as a GM move or to represent the cost, complication, or consequence of an action roll.

**Stress Effects**:
- When a character marks their last Stress, they become **Vulnerable** until they clear at least 1 Stress
- When a character must mark 1 or more Stress but can't, they mark 1 HP instead
- A character can't use a move that requires them to mark Stress if all of their Stress is marked

## Attack Mechanics

### Attack Rolls
An attack roll is an action roll intended to inflict harm. The trait that applies to an attack roll is specified by the weapon or spell being used. Unarmed attack rolls use either Strength or Finesse (GM's choice).

### Damage Rolls
When an attack succeeds, the attacker rolls damage dice. The number and type of dice rolled depends on the weapon or spell being used.

### Reaction Rolls
Reaction rolls are made when a character needs to respond quickly to a threat or opportunity. These rolls typically use Agility or Insight.

## Combat Flow

### Turn Structure
1. **On Your Turn**: Choose your action
2. **Make Action Roll**: Roll Duality Dice + relevant trait
3. **Apply Results**: Success or failure with consequences
4. **GM Response**: GM makes moves based on results

### Action Types
- **Attack Actions**: Direct offensive moves
- **Defensive Actions**: Protecting yourself or others
- **Support Actions**: Helping allies
- **Movement Actions**: Changing position or environment

## Conditions

### Vulnerable
- Triggered when a character marks their last Stress
- Lasts until at least 1 Stress is cleared
- May affect certain abilities or rolls

### Other Conditions
Various conditions can affect combat effectiveness, including:
- **Stunned**: Cannot take actions
- **Prone**: Easier to hit, harder to attack
- **Grappled**: Movement restricted
- **Blinded**: Cannot see targets clearly

## Advantage & Disadvantage

### Advantage
- Roll an additional d12 and take the higher result
- Can be granted by positioning, preparation, or special abilities

### Disadvantage
- Roll an additional d12 and take the lower result
- Can be caused by difficult circumstances, conditions, or penalties

## Special Combat Rules

### Tag Team Actions
Spend 3 Hope to initiate a Tag Team roll, combining the actions of two PCs into one impressive act of synergy. When you make a Tag Team roll, both players roll their action rolls and then choose which set of results to apply to the outcome.

### Hope Features
A Hope Feature is any effect that allows (or requires) you to spend a specified amount of Hope to activate it. Class Hope features are class-specific features, detailed on your character sheet, that cost 3 Hope to activate.

**Note**: When using a Hope Feature, if you rolled with Hope for that action, the Hope you gain from that roll can be spent on that feature.

### Fear System
The GM gains Fear whenever a player rolls with Fear and can spend Fear at any time to make or enhance a GM move or to use a Fear Feature. The GM can have up to 12 Fear at one time. Fear carries over between sessions.

## Combat Resolution

### Falling
When a character marks their last Hit Point, they fall. If a PC falls, they make a death move.

### Recovery
Characters can clear Hit Points by taking downtime moves or by activating relevant special abilities or effects.

### Optional Rule: Massive Damage
If a character ever takes damage equal to twice their Severe threshold, they mark 4 HP instead of 3.

## Combat Best Practices

### For Players
- **Coordinate with allies** for effective teamwork
- **Use the environment** to your advantage
- **Manage resources** (Hope, Stress, HP) carefully
- **Communicate intentions** clearly with the GM

# Character Creation Rules - Daggerheart

## Character Creation Process

### STEP 1: Choose a Class and Subclass

Classes are role-based archetypes that determine which class features and domain cards a PC gains access to throughout the campaign. There are nine classes in this SRD: **Bard, Druid, Guardian, Ranger, Rogue, Seraph, Sorcerer, Warrior, Wizard**.

- Select a class and take its corresponding character sheet and character guide printouts
- Every class begins with one or more unique class feature(s), described at the bottom left of each class's character sheet
- Choose a Subclass: Each class comprises two subclasses. Select one of your class's subclasses and take its Foundation card

### STEP 2: Choose Your Heritage

Your character's heritage combines two elements: ancestry and community.

#### Ancestry
A character's ancestry represents their species or lineage; it grants them certain physical traits and two unique ancestry features. Choose from: **Clank, Drakona, Dwarf, Elf, Faerie, Faun, Firbolg, Fungril, Galapa, Giant, Goblin, Halfling, Human, Infernis, Katari, Orc, Ribbet, Simiah**.

To create a Mixed Ancestry, take the top (first-listed) ancestry feature from one ancestry and the bottom (second-listed) ancestry feature from another.

#### Community
Your character's community represents their culture and the environment they grew up in. Choose from: **Academy, City, Court, Frontier, Guild, Military, Nomad, Outlaw, Temple, Underworld, Wilderness**.

### STEP 3: Assign Character Traits

Distribute the values **-1, 0, 0, +1, +1, +2** across your character traits:
- **Agility** (AGI)
- **Insight** (INS) 
- **Might** (MIG)
- **Persona** (PER)
- **Learning** (LRN)
- **Will** (WIL)

When rolling, you'll add the value of that character trait to the roll.

- Record your starting **Evasion** (based on class)
- Record your starting **Hit Points (HP)** (5-6 HP)
- Record your starting **Stress** (6 Stress)

### STEP 6: Create Your Background

- Make description choices from the available options on your character guide

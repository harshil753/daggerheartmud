# DAGGERHEART CHARACTER CREATION RULES

## INTRODUCTION

### WELCOME TO DAGGERHEART

*Daggerheart* is a collaborative fantasy roleplaying game of incredible magic and heroic adventure. During your journeys, you may find yourself rubbing elbows with nobles to investigate and stop an assassination plot, delving into an ancient dungeon to prevent an apocalyptic creature from breaking free, sailing across a vast ocean to face a terrifying sea monster, or preventing a precious relic from falling into the hands of a dangerous enemy. No matter the adventure your party embarks upon, *Daggerheart* provides the tools to tell a story that is both heartfelt and epic.

### WHAT IS A TABLETOP ROLEPLAYING GAME?

A tabletop roleplaying game, or TTRPG, is an interactive storytelling experience where players take on the roles of characters within a shared world and collaborate to tell a story about those characters. *Daggerheart* is meant to be played by three to six people—known as your group or table—with one person taking on the role of the game master (or GM) while the others each play a single character, referred to as a player character (or PC). The GM facilitates the story that takes shape around the PCs—they introduce rewards, complications, and consequences to the narrative, embody the story's other characters (also known as non-player characters or NPCs), and help the story progress each time you play together.

Like many roleplaying games, *Daggerheart* uses dice to determine the outcome of some uncertain events, providing an element of unpredictability to the results of choices you make. Even so, the game embraces player agency and imagination; the type of character you choose to play and the decisions you make about their background and experiences will make your odds better (or worse!) on those dice rolls.

If you're looking for a TTRPG that tells heroic fantasy stories with a modern approach to mechanics, focusing on both epic battles and the emotional narrative of the characters who fight in them, you've come to the right place.

*Daggerheart* also utilizes an asymmetrical design, meaning that it plays differently for the GM than it does for the players. Players roll two twelve-sided dice for their PCs' standard actions, including their attacks. The GM can make most moves without dice, but they roll a twenty-sided die for adversary moves that require a roll. This asymmetrical design is intended to help all participants contribute to a memorable experience for everyone at the table.

### HEART OF THE GAME

In *Daggerheart*, you and your fellow players all take turns describing what your characters do. The GM determines the consequences of those actions, then guides the group into collaboratively evolving the narrative because of those consequences. When the rules call for it, or when a situation demands, you'll roll the dice to inform what happens next. Depending on the result of the roll, the events of the ongoing story will unfold in new and unexpected ways.

There is no winning or losing in *Daggerheart* in the traditional "gaming" sense. The game is a collaborative storytelling experience, where the goal is to play out an incredible story together. Even if the characters fail to achieve their goals right away, make big mistakes, or even die, they never "lose." If a character dies, the party can look for a way to bring them back to life, or that player can make a new character for the party to meet along their journey. If the group fails to stop the villain from enacting a terrible plan, they might face the consequences of that failure and try to make it right. If they succeed, they may triumphantly win the day—or they might anger or embolden an even stronger enemy who retaliates. No matter what happens during the story, as long as you're working together to craft a narrative that is fun and exciting to everyone, you've already won.

### WHAT KIND OF ROLEPLAYING GAME IS DAGGERHEART?

*Daggerheart* is a heroic, narrative-focused experience that features combat as a prominent aspect of play. The system facilitates emotionally engaging, player-driven stories punctuated by exciting battles and harrowing challenges. The game takes a fiction-first approach, encouraging players and GMs to act in good faith with one another and focus on the story they're telling rather than the complexity of the mechanics. The rules provide structure when it's unclear how actions or moments will resolve within that story. The system takes a free-flowing approach to combat to avoid slowing the game down with granular rounds, and it doesn't rely on grid-based movement for maps and minis. These aspects coalesce to create a game that allows for the terrain and map-building that miniature-based systems are known for while facilitating a streamlined, narrative experience for players.

### CORE MECHANICS OVERVIEW

The dice players use in Daggerheart most commonly fall into two different categories—your Duality Dice and your damage dice. Your Duality Dice are two differently colored twelve-sided dice (or d12s) that represent Hope and Fear. These dice embody the fate of the world and its effect on the characters' success. Your damage dice correspond to the weapon or spell your character wields, expressing the deadliness of a successful attack.

When you roll to see whether your character succeeds or fails at a task or challenge, you roll your Duality Dice and take the sum of their results, then add any bonuses your character has that apply to the action. If that total is equal to or higher than the Difficulty set by the GM, your character succeeds. If it's lower, they fail. You'll also tell the GM whether your Hope or Fear Die rolled higher, as the situation around you changes based on that result.

### THE GOLDEN RULE

The most important rule of Daggerheart is to make the game your own. The rules included in this book are designed to help you enjoy the experience at the table, but everyone has a different approach to interpreting rules and telling stories. The rules should never get in the way of the story you want to tell, the characters you want to play, or the adventures you want to have. As long as your group agrees, everything can be adjusted to fit your play style. If there's a rule you'd rather ignore or modify, feel free to implement any change with your table's consent.

## RULINGS OVER RULES

While playing Daggerheart, the GM and players should always prioritize rulings over rules. This book offers answers for many questions your table may have about the game, but it won't answer all of them. When you're in doubt about how a rule applies, the GM should make a ruling that aligns with the narrative.

For example, Daggerheart has a weapon called a grappler that lets you pull a target close to you. If you try to use it to pull an entire castle, the weapon text doesn't forbid you from doing that—but it doesn't make sense within the narrative. Instead, the GM might rule that you pull a few bricks out, or pull yourself toward the wall instead.

Similarly, if your character does something that would logically result in immediate death—such as diving into an active volcano without protection—you might not get to make one of Daggerheart's death moves, which normally give you control of your character's fate in their final moments. This kind of consequence should be made clear before the action is completed, and it should always follow the logic of the world. As a narrative-focused game, Daggerheart is not a place where technical, out-of-context interpretations of the rules are encouraged. Everything should flow back to the fiction, and the GM has the authority and responsibility to make rulings about how rules are applied to underscore that fiction.

### WHAT DO YOU NEED TO PLAY?

*Most of the tools required to play a session of Daggerheart are included with this book, but there are a few additional components you'll need to gather before you begin.*

#### 2–5 PLAYERS

Daggerheart runs best with two to five players who are excited to collaborate and build a story together. If you're playing a PC, your responsibility is to adopt the mentality of your character and decide what they do. The GM will present problems and obstacles, and you'll figure out how to tackle those challenges in a way that makes your game most interesting. As a player, it's your job to shape your character's story through the choices you make and spotlight the other characters as they, too, grow on this journey.

#### A GAME MASTER

If you're taking on the role of the GM, you'll be playing the world as it responds to the PCs' actions. That means you'll set exciting scenes for the characters, manage the flow of the story, and play any NPCs, including the adversaries the characters will face. You'll also ask the players questions that drive the narrative forward. Often, you'll be the one who knows the rules and can answer questions about mechanics during play. If a judgment needs to be made during a session about a rule or mechanic that's not in the rulebook, you'll be the one to make that decision.

As a GM, it's important to remember that you're not an antagonistic force against the players. Though you're the one introducing the dangers and complications in a scene, the thrilling challenges you provide are meant to let the players showcase their characters' strengths and face their characters' flaws. Be a fan of the characters and a collaborator with the other players at your table.

#### GAME DICE

Daggerheart uses the full suite of polyhedral dice: d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100. When referring to a quantity of dice beyond a single die, the game indicates how many and which kind, such as 2d6 (two six-sided dice) or 3d8 (three eight-sided dice). Players will need 2d12 of different colors (your Duality Dice) and at least one set of polyhedral dice to share amongst the table. You may find it easier for each person to have their own set. As your character levels up, you'll be rolling more dice to represent those advancements, so it may be helpful to bring another set or two. The GM will also need their own set of dice to run adversaries.

#### TOKENS

Character tokens are small objects that represent the look and feel of your character. Gather about seven tokens per player to start. You will need more as your character levels up—while the amount varies depending on the character build, you likely won't need more than fifteen tokens at level 10.

As you play the game, you'll use these tokens to help track several things:

* When you roll dice, you'll add tokens to help you easily count the modifiers on the roll.
* To use certain features, you might be required to place tokens on the card or character sheet.

These tokens not only make your rolls easier to resolve, but they also provide an opportunity to further express the style and color palette of your character. You can use any small object (plastic gems, pennies, buttons), but we recommend something no larger than a quarter that can sit on the table without rolling away. Ideally, each player's tokens should be visually distinct to avoid confusion.

The GM can use tokens to track their accumulated Fear and as counters on adversary stat blocks.

#### GAME CARDS

Along with this rulebook, you'll also need the cards that come with the core set: ancestry, community, subclass, and domain cards. If you don't have a physical set of cards (or need extra copies), you can download and print the cards at home. The "Domain Card Reference" section in the appendix also contains the text for cards from the core set.

#### CHARACTER SHEETS AND NOTES

The appendix contains a general character sheet and the guides you can use to build your characters, but we recommend using the class-specific character sheets from www.daggerheart.com for the best experience. The remainder of this rulebook will assume you're using the class-specific sheets. If you're using pencil and paper, you'll want to have these materials printed out. If you're using a digital version instead, ensure you have a laptop or tablet available to view and edit your character sheet and guide during the game.

We also recommend paper and writing utensils (or a digital equivalent) to record important details that the GM or other players share.

#### OPTIONAL: MAPS AND MINIATURES

You can use maps and miniatures to represent the scenarios the players are facing, especially during battle, to more fully illustrate the scene, rather than relying on only narration and description. When drawing or building a map, the scale, distance, and details won't always be perfect, and that's okay. The maps and the miniatures should never limit your imagination—only provide extra spatial context so everyone can picture the scene clearly.

### PLAYER PRINCIPLES

*We recommend following these principles when engaging with Daggerheart as a player to get the most out of the system.*

→ Be a fan of your character and their journey.  
→ Spotlight your friends.  
→ Address the characters and address the players.  
→ Build the world together.  
→ Play to find out what happens.  
→ Hold on gently.

#### BE A FAN OF YOUR CHARACTER AND THEIR JOURNEY

Find ways to show off what your character does best and what they do worst. Strive to make interesting choices and learn more about who they are through play. Push your character's story forward and let them grow with the fiction.

#### SPOTLIGHT YOUR FRIENDS

Look for opportunities to put other characters in the spotlight. Provide them openings to do what they do best, ask them for help and offer yours freely, and prompt them to share more of their thoughts and feelings.

#### ADDRESS THE CHARACTERS AND ADDRESS THE PLAYERS

Speak to the other characters within the world of the fiction. Lean on the connections you build together, ask them questions, and create a story using your conversations as well as your actions.

Speak to the other players outside of the fiction. Ask them what their character might do and what they want to see happen in the narrative. As you play, be considerate of their preferences and desires.

#### BUILD THE WORLD TOGETHER

In Daggerheart, every participant is a storyteller, not just the GM. Daggerheart is a highly collaborative game and reaches its greatest potential when every player (including the GM) is working together. This means actively advocating for the story beats you want to see, offering suggestions to enrich the arcs of the other player characters, creating parts of the world with others at the table, and thinking deeply about your character's motivations.

#### PLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS

Everything you do at the table should flow from the fiction. Listen to your fellow players and the GM—then react to what their characters say and do to discover the story together as you build on each other's creativity. If you roll the dice, let the results lead you through what happens next. Embrace complications with the same vigor with which you celebrate victories.

#### HOLD ON GENTLY

Improvisational storytelling isn't always perfect, and that's okay. Hold on gently to the fiction—enough that you don't lose the pieces that matter, but not so tightly that the narrative has no room to breathe. Let yourself make mistakes and make changes. Smooth the edges and shape them to fit the story. Even if the story beats don't go the way you expect or a sudden twist catches you by surprise, trust that the GM and your fellow players will all create something beautiful and memorable by the end.

Following these principles will help guide you in telling exciting, unpredictable, and meaningful stories together at your table.

### A TABLE FOR ALL

Daggerheart is a game for players of all races, ethnicities, genders, faiths, sexualities, and identities. It is the responsibility of each player in the game to ensure that the table you share is a place where everyone is empowered, respected, and safe.

Because of the nature of open-ended storytelling in roleplaying games, it's possible to touch upon topics that might be difficult or sensitive for some players. Subject matter that might just be an imaginary scenario for you could bring up a real-life topic that is personal or uncomfortable for somebody else. When you gather to play for the first time, make sure that you talk through what kind of experience you're all looking to have, and bring up any themes or topics you'd like to avoid. Everyone should abide by this social contract, and add to or modify it at any time as needed.

The "Session Zero and Safety Tools" section in chapter 3 presents resources you can use to help navigate difficult scenarios together.

## CHAPTER ONE: PREPARING FOR ADVENTURE

*In this chapter, you'll prepare for your first game of Daggerheart. The upcoming sections describe Daggerheart's worldbuilding fundamentals, then walk you through creating a character while providing information on each of the classes, domains, ancestries, and communities.*

### WORLD OVERVIEW

Daggerheart encourages the exploration of worlds filled with great magic, wondrous landscapes, mythical beasts, dynamic factions, rousing mysteries, and powerful foes. While the world your table collaboratively creates will be your own, Daggerheart has established ancestries, communities, classes, abilities, and spells—so some worldbuilding aspects will exist similarly across every campaign.

The following section describes the core realms, where these shared details derive from. These details can always be reflavored or modified to match the style of game your group wants to play. When creating your table's unique world, you can use one of the following as a starting point: an existing location you're already familiar with, a supplemental setting book, the guide for creating your own world in the "Running a Campaign" section in chapter 3, or a campaign frame from chapter 5.

### CORE REALMS

The **core realms** are the basis for the worldbuilding elements inherent to many of Daggerheart's mechanics, such as its ancestries and adversaries.

#### THE MORTAL REALM

Most adventures will likely take place in the Mortal Realm. This is the land, sea, and sky, where mortals live out the entirety of their lives—the plane where the majority of all material beings and objects exist. Stories say this realm was created by the Forgotten Gods during the Earliest Age and that these immortals traveled between the Hallows Above and this new plane as easily as waking from a dream. During this time, the gods were familiar to the mortals and acts of divinity were commonplace—be they wonderful or terrifying. When the Forgotten Gods were overthrown by the New Gods, many of these ancient deities were trapped within this plane eternally.

This realm is also occupied by the Faint Divinities, lesser deities created by both the Forgotten and the New Gods to oversee the Mortal Realm. Many are considered to be quite capricious, and though their spheres of influence are smaller than the gods who created them, they can greatly influence the lives of mortals.

#### THE HALLOWS ABOVE

The Hallows Above are the collection of deific territories that once belonged to the Forgotten Gods before the New Gods claimed it at the end of the Earliest Age. Because this place is closely connected with most other realms, the gods residing here can see and speak with the creatures of the Mortal Realm without leaving their domain, though those with whom the gods communicate may find their methods strange or obfuscated. There are ways by which the New Gods can leave the Hallows Above to occupy other realms, but in the current age they must always sacrifice something of personal importance to do so. It's rumored that this burden was necessitated by their desire to protect the Hallows from the Forgotten Gods should they rise again, as the Forgotten Gods (or any being from the Mortal Realm) would also have to forfeit much to enter the Hallows Above. These sacrifices have caused some of the great calamities that have befallen the Mortal Realm in recent millennia.

#### THE CIRCLES BELOW

The Circles Below are the collection of lower realms where many of the Forgotten Gods, those who fought the most passionately during the uprising, were banished. Known as "the Fallen Gods," these deities lost the Divine War with the New Gods during the Earliest Age and have since been deemed "evil practitioners of tainted magic." Thus the Faint Divinities who were banished alongside them are commonly referred to as "demons," and those that descended from these creatures also bear the weight of that identifier.

The Circles Below are considered places of corruption, destruction, and violence. Stories say this dominion is home to some of the most dangerous creatures in the core realms. Most other planes have safeguards against Fallen who wish to cross from the Circles Below. Within the Mortal Realm, the use of arcane magic in acts of great evil is said to open a temporary rift between the two planes, allowing Fallen to pass through.

#### THE REALMS BEYOND

The cosmos holds many realms beyond these—the Elemental Lands, the Astral Realm, the Valley of Death, and countless others. Accessing and traversing these places from the Mortal Realm requires specialized knowledge and hard-learned skills. Still, some of the beings in the core realms guard these secrets closely and could be persuaded to share them—for a price.

### MAGIC AND SPELLS

Depending on the kind of character you play, they may or may not have the ability to use magic. Magic in Daggerheart is both very powerful and incredibly dangerous, permeating the land and manifesting within the people. It is both a force within you that can aid you throughout your journey and a force outside of you that affects the world.

If your character does have the power of spellcasting, you'll use magic through specific weapons, spells, and other means. As characters grow, the magic they can perform grows with them. Each level, you gain cards that describe the new, powerful magic they can wield and the specific parameters for using it.

### FLAVORING YOUR GAME

If the default portrayal of your character's mechanical effects doesn't fit them and their style, you can always describe them in a way that does. This is often called "flavoring." However, unless your table agrees, that flavor shouldn't offer any mechanical effect beyond the effect's existing description.

For instance, you might say that your rogue's magic takes the form of gadgets and inventions, instead of magically creating a dark cloud, they drop a smoke grenade. Or perhaps your ranger's magic takes the form of ancestral spirits who draw forth the forces of nature. Perhaps magic works in an entirely different way in your lore, and you explain how every class's power emerges from a different source. As long as it abides by the mechanics of the game, you're encouraged to flavor your magic to suit your character.

You can reflavor items, as well. Your character might have a unique weapon from their heritage, but it uses the statistics of a longsword. Your wizard's armor might come in the form of a set of empowered runes instead of chainmail, but they still have Armor Slots you can spend to reduce damage. In this case, "repairing" your armor during a rest could mean replenishing the enchantment. The "Adjusting Abilities and Spells" section of this chapter suggests other ways you can tailor your spells and abilities to fit your character and comfort level.

## CHARACTER CREATION

*Unless you're the GM, the first step of Daggerheart is to create your character. In addition to choosing their class, community, and ancestry, you're also responsible for crafting their physical appearance, personality, and prior experience, as well as their relationships with the other characters. Some of these decisions are purely narrative, meaning they only appear in the game through your roleplaying, but others are mechanical choices that affect the actions you're more (or less) likely to succeed at when rolling your dice.*

### GETTING STARTED

Before you create your character, discuss the campaign with your table and begin brainstorming ideas.  
**Tip:** *There are many mechanics mentioned in the Character Creation section that will be fully covered in chapter 2.*

#### HAVE A SESSION ZERO

If you're preparing to start a new campaign with your group, we recommend that you use your first session together to build characters and talk about the world you'll be playing in. This is often called a session zero (see the "Session Zero and Safety Tools" section on page 169) and is the best way to ensure that everyone is on the same page about the tone and feel of the campaign so you can create characters who work well together.

#### THINK ABOUT CHARACTER CONCEPTS

Before you begin the character-building process, it can be helpful to review the materials and formulate an idea for what type of character you want to play. Your concept can be surface-level and general—such as "a circus performer who uses magic" or "a captain who lost their ship at sea"—but having even a basic starting point will help you make choices as you move through each of the following step.

### STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR CLASS

The first step of character creation is to choose the **class** you want to play. Each class is a role-based archetype that determines what abilities you have access to throughout the campaign. For example, you might choose to play a guardian if you want to be the "tank" of your group who runs into fights headfirst and protects others with their own life. You might choose to be a wizard if you want to cast unique spells to solve problems, heal party members, and wield cunning battle magic.

Once you've chosen a class, you'll also choose a **subclass**.  
The subclasses are subsets of each class that further define your character's archetype.

### CLASS OPTIONS

*The following classes and subclasses are available in the core rulebook:*

#### BARD  
**Subclasses:** *Troubadour* or *Wordsmith*

> **Play the Troubadour**  
> if you want to play music

#### GUARDIAN  
**Subclasses:** *Stalwart* or *Vengeance*

> **Play the Stalwart**

**Subclasses:** *Beastbound* or *Wayfinder*

> **Play the Beastbound**  
> if you want to form a deep  
> bond with an animal ally.

> and strike with deadly force.

#### ROGUE  
**Subclasses:** *Nightwalker* or *Syndicate*

**Play the Nightwalker**  
if you want to manipulate shadows to maneuver through the environment.

**Play the Syndicate**  
if you want to have a web of contacts everywhere you go.

#### SERAPH  
**Subclasses:** *Divine Wielder* or *Winged Sentinel*

**Play the Winged Sentinel**  
if you want to take flight and strike crushing blows from the sky.

**Play the Divine Wielder**  
if you want to dominate the battlefield with a legendary weapon.

#### SORCERER  
**Subclasses:** *Elemental Origin* or *Primal Origin*

**Play the Elemental Origin**  
if you want to channel the raw power of a particular element.

**Play the Primal Origin**  
if you want to extend the versatility of your spells in powerful ways.

#### WARRIOR  
**Subclasses:** *Call of the Brave* or *Call of the Slayer*

**Play the Call of the Brave**  
if you want to use the might of your enemies to fuel your own power.

**Play the Call of the Slayer**  
if you want to strike down adversaries with immense force.

#### WIZARD  
**Subclasses:** *School of Knowledge* or *School of War*

**Play the School of Knowledge**  
if you want a keen understanding of the world around you.

**Play the School of War**  
if you want to utilize trained magic for violence.

*You can learn more about these classes in the upcoming "Class" section.*

### CHARACTER SHEET, CHARACTER GUIDE, AND SUBCLASS CARD

Once you've chosen your class, grab the corresponding character sheet and character guide, then decide on a subclass and take that subclass's foundation card. The character sheet is for recording your character's details, so make sure you have paper or digital copies available. If you're filling out a hard copy, use a pencil, as you'll change details on the sheet as your character levels up. You can find a completed character sheet in the upcoming "Example Character" section.

Customized character sheets and character guides are available for download at www.daggerheart.com. A general character sheet is also available in the appendix.

#### RECORD YOUR LEVEL

Characters in Daggerheart start at level 1. Record your level in the appropriate section at the top of your character sheet, and make sure to change it every time you level up. We recommend starting your campaign at level 1, but a more experienced table can start at a higher level if the GM and players prefer.

#### RECORD CHARACTER DETAILS

At any point in the character creation process, feel free to fill out your character's name and pronouns on the top line, as well as the Character Description details on the character guide. For some people, their character's name and appearance come first, and for others, it takes time to discover what's right. As long as you have a name and description by the time your table is finished with character creation, it doesn't matter what order you complete these steps in.

#### CLASS FEATURE

Every class begins with a unique **class feature** (or several). You don't have to write these features down—they're provided at the bottom left of each class's character sheet. These are features available only to your class. If your class feature asks you to make a selection during character creation, make it before your first session.

### STEP 2: CHOOSE YOUR HERITAGE

Next, choose your character's **heritage**. This aspect of your character includes two elements—their ancestry and their community.

#### CHOOSE YOUR ANCESTRY

A character's **ancestry** reflects their lineage, impacting their physicality and granting them two unique features. Take the card for one of the following ancestries, then write its name in the Heritage field of your character sheet:

| Clank | Firbolg | Human |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Drakona | Fungril | Infernis |
| Dwarf | Galapa | Katari |
| Elf | Giant | Orc |
| Faerie | Goblin | Ribbet |
| Faun | Halfling | Simiah |

> You can learn more about these ancestries in the upcoming "Ancestry" section.

#### CHOOSE YOUR COMMUNITY

Next, you'll choose a **community** from the available community cards. Your character's community is influenced by its physical location, values, and goals. It informs the culture your character grew up in and might play a part in the way they look, act, or approach situations. Each community comes with a feature that you can utilize during the game. Take the card for one of the following communities, then write its name in the Heritage field of your character sheet:

| Highborne | Ridgeborne | Underborne |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| Loreborne | Seaborne | Wanderborne |
| Orderborne | Slyborne | Wildborne |

> You can learn more about these communities in the upcoming "Community" section.

#### LANGUAGES

In Daggerheart, you're not asked to pick specific languages for your character. This game assumes that everyone speaks a common language (it's up to you whether that's through mundane or magical means) and that sign language is widely understood across cultures and communities. If you'd like to have specific regional languages in your campaign, discuss options with your table.

### STEP 3: ASSIGN CHARACTER TRAITS

Next, you'll assign values to the **character traits** on your character sheet. These values reflect your natural or trained ability in each of the core six stats: Agility, Strength, Finesse, Instinct, Presence, and Knowledge. Each trait lists verbs (such as Sprint, Leap, and Maneuver) that show the types of actions a character might perform that involve that trait. These examples are just inspiration—they shouldn't limit how each trait can be used.

**AGILITY: Sprint, Leap, Maneuver**  
A high Agility means you're fast on your feet, nimble on difficult terrain, and quick to react to danger. You'll make an Agility Roll to scurry up a rope, sprint to cover, or bound from rooftop to rooftop.

**STRENGTH: Lift, Smash, Grapple**  
A high Strength means you're better at feats that test your physical prowess and stamina. You'll make a Strength Roll to break through a door, lift heavy objects, or hold your ground against a charging foe.

**FINESSE: Control, Hide, Tinker**  
A high Finesse means you're skilled at tasks that require accuracy, stealth, or the utmost control. You'll make a Finesse Roll to use fine tools, escape notice, or strike with precision.

**INSTINCT: Perceive, Sense, Navigate**  
A high Instinct means you have a keen sense of your surroundings and a natural intuition. You'll make an Instinct Roll to sense danger, notice details in the world around you, or track an elusive foe.

**PRESENCE: Charm, Perform, Deceive**  
A high Presence means you have a strong force of personality and a facility for social situations. You'll make a Presence Roll to plead your case, intimidate a foe, or capture the attention of a crowd.

**KNOWLEDGE: Recall, Analyze, Comprehend**  
A high Knowledge means you know information others don't and understand how to apply your mind through deduction and inference. You'll make a Knowledge Roll to interpret facts, see the patterns clearly, or remember important information.

### DISTRIBUTE TRAIT MODIFIERS

Trait **modifiers** are the values associated with each trait. When you make an action roll using one of these traits, that trait's modifier is added to the roll to determine the final result (or subtracted from the roll for a negative modifier).

Distribute the following starting modifiers across your character's traits in any order you wish:  
+2, +1, +1, 0, 0, −1.

When distributing these modifiers, consider what actions you want your character to be good at, what weapon you want to use for your attacks, and what kind of spellcasting you'll be doing, if any. Weapons and spells are covered in future sections, but the character guide for your class offers suggested placement for your modifiers if you want a starting point. You can also rearrange your modifiers as needed during character creation, as well as after your first few sessions of play.

If you ever need to refer to your trait modifiers as values (if a card or effect references your Agility, Presence, etc.) a +2 would be considered 2, and a −1 would still be considered −1. For example, if a domain card tells you to place a number of tokens equal to your character's Knowledge on that card, and their Knowledge is +3, you would place 3 tokens on the card. If they have a negative modifier in that trait, you instead would place no tokens on the card (unless otherwise noted).

### STEP 4: RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARACTER INFORMATION

It's time to take a quick break from making choices and instead fill out a few sections of your character sheet.

#### EVASION  
Your character's **Evasion** reflects how hard it is for adversaries to hit them. Your class's starting Evasion appears right beneath the Evasion field on your character sheet; copy this number into the Evasion field. When an adversary makes an attack against your character, the GM rolls against their Evasion to see if the adversary succeeds. You can choose how your character's Evasion manifests within the narrative—a wizard might avoid blows with shimmering arcane shields or bat away an adversary's spells, while a ranger nimbly dodges out of the way of attacks and a warrior parries, blocks, and dodges.

Your character's Evasion starts low, but that's because it's not their only means of avoiding damage. If they're hit, you'll also have the opportunity to reduce the incoming damage using armor.

#### HIT POINTS AND STRESS  
Your character's health and well-being are represented by Hit Points and Stress. **Hit Points** (sometimes called HP) are an abstract reflection of your physical fortitude and ability to take hits from both blade and magic. Each class starts with a set number of Hit Points. **Stress** reflects your ability to withstand the pressures of dangerous situations and mental strain. Every class starts with 6 Stress.

You can describe your character's Hit Points and Stress any way you wish, but they generally represent your character's ability to get knocked down and keep coming back. You'll mark your character's Hit Points and Stress when these situations arise—and the fewer marks you have, the better.

#### HOPE AND FEAR  
**Hope** and **Fear** are currencies used by the players and the GM to represent the way fate turns for or against the characters during the game. You start with 2 Hope; mark these in the Hope field of your character sheet.

Any time you **roll with Hope** on your Duality Dice—meaning your Hope Die rolled higher than your Fear Die—you gain a Hope (to a maximum of 6). During the game, you can spend Hope to help your character's allies, apply their life experiences to challenges, and empower their spells and abilities.

If you instead **roll with Fear** on your Duality Dice—meaning your Fear Die rolled higher than your Hope Die—the GM gains a Fear that they can spend on certain effects. Sometimes a Fear roll introduces other complications into a scene (even if you succeed on your roll).

### STEP 5: CHOOSE YOUR STARTING EQUIPMENT

Next, you'll choose starting weapons, armor, and other items for your character.

#### CHOOSE YOUR WEAPONS  
You use **physical weapons** to attack your foes—and if you have a Spellcast trait (such as from your subclass), you can also wield **magic weapons**. At character creation, you can choose either a two-handed **primary weapon**, or a one-handed primary weapon and a one-handed **secondary weapon**, then equip them.

You can find weapon suggestions at the top of your character guide, but if you'd like to choose your own, you can find all starting (Tier 1) weapons in the "Primary Weapon Tables" and "Secondary Weapon Tables" sections in chapter 2. (These are also available as a separate sheet to print out from the Daggerheart website or in the appendix.)

At Level 1, your **Proficiency** is 1. This means you'll roll one damage die for your weapon attacks. In the Active Weapons area of your character sheet, this is recorded in the Proficiency field.

> **Tip:** In the area of your character labeled Damage Dice & Type, record your damage dice with the Proficiency value already written in (like `1d6+3` instead of `d6+3`), to remind yourself how many weapon dice to roll. Whenever you increase your Proficiency, you also increase the number of dice in the damage dice field to reflect this change. For example, when your Proficiency becomes 2, you would change it to `"2d6+3"` instead.

#### CHOOSE YOUR ARMOR  
You use **armor** to reduce the severity of incoming attacks. At character creation, you can choose one set of armor and equip it. You can find armor suggestions at the top of your character guide, but if you'd like to choose your own, you can find all starting (Tier 1) armor in the "Armor Tables" section in chapter 2. (These are also available as a separate sheet to print out from the Daggerheart website or in the appendix.) When your character equips armor, record its details in the Active Armor fields of your character sheet.

An armor's **damage thresholds** (shown in the "Base Thresholds" column) indicate how much damage a character can endure before marking Hit Points. Add your character's level to both values and record the total for both numbers in the corresponding fields. In the "Hit Points and Damage Thresholds" section of chapter 2, you'll learn how many Hit Points to mark on your character sheet each time your character takes damage.

Then, in the Armor field at the top left of your character sheet, record your **Armor Score**. This score includes the armor's base value (shown in the "Base Score" column) plus any permanent bonuses your character has to their Armor Score from other abilities. When your character takes damage, you can mark one of the small shield symbols next to your Armor Score (called an **Armor Slot**), then reduce the severity of the damage by one threshold: Severe to Major, Major to Minor, or Minor to None. You can only mark one Armor Slot per attack, and you have a number of slots equal to your Armor Score.

#### CHOOSE OTHER STARTING ITEMS

Your **inventory** includes anything else your character is carrying. The top of your character guide lists all their starting inventory items, which include the following:

* Torch (useful for illuminating a dark room)  
* 50 feet of rope (useful for climbing a wall or rappelling down a cliff)  
* Basic supplies (tent, bedroll, tinderbox, rations, etc.)  
* A handful of gold (record this in the Gold field in the left-hand column of your character sheet)  
* Your choice of a Minor Health Potion (clear 1d4 Hit Points) or a Minor Stamina Potion (clear 1d4 Stress)  
* The "and either" option on your character guide is specific to your class. You might also be asked to choose what you use to carry your spells.

Record these items in the Inventory fields of your character sheet. This equipment is available to use during the party's adventures in any way that fits the shared story. We encourage you to use items creatively, as long as the GM agrees and it fits the rules of the world.

You can also talk to your GM about other items you'd like to have at the start of the game. There are no rules limiting the size of your inventory, so items that don't provide a mechanical benefit but make sense for your character to have are normally okay—but your GM always makes the final call.

### STEP 6: CREATE YOUR BACKGROUND

Next, explore your character's **background** by answering the background questions in your character guide. Several prompts are provided to jumpstart inspiration, but you or the GM can modify or replace these questions to fit the character you're looking to play. The prompts are a jumping-off point if you don't know where to start, but they should never inhibit your creativity.

The decisions you make about your character's background are purely narrative, but they deeply impact the character you're playing and the story the GM is preparing for your adventures. Over the course of character creation, feel free to adjust mechanical choices you made in earlier steps to better reflect this background as you shape your character.

If you're planning to play in a campaign, you can continue developing your character after the background questions in whatever way works best for you. Just remember to give the GM your backstory so they can work any people, places, or ideas from it into the campaign. You can also choose not to do any more background work, instead finding out more about your character as you play. Lean into a process that's fun for you.

### STEP 7: CREATE YOUR EXPERIENCES

In Daggerheart, your character's Experiences are one of the core ways you express their backstory and expertise through mechanics. An *Experience* is a word or phrase used to encapsulate a specific set of skills your character has acquired over the course of their exciting life.

Your character starts with two Experiences at character creation (each with a +2 modifier), and they'll earn more throughout your adventures. Before creating Experiences, you'll want to have a solid idea of who your character is; the background questions are especially helpful for this. When you're ready, work with your GM to create two Experiences that have shaped your character.

There's no set list of Experiences to choose from (though we offer options for inspiration under "Experience Examples"). Instead, find a word or phrase that embodies something distinctive about your character. Each Experience should be specific. For example, *Talented* or *Focused* are too broad, as they can be applied to almost any situation; instead you might use *Swashbuckler* or *Magic Studies*. Additionally, your character's Experience can't give them spells or specific game abilities. For example, *Take Flight* or *One-Hit Kill* are too mechanically oriented; you might consider *Pilot* or *Assassin* instead.

You are also encouraged to add flavor to your character's Experience to give it more varied use in play. For example, instead of just *Assassin*, you could choose *Assassin of the Sapphire Syndicate*. Details like this give your GM an exciting faction to weave into the campaign, and also make it easier to use this Experience outside combat. For example, if your character encounters an ally of the syndicate, they might be particularly adept at negotiating with that NPC based on their Experience.

Once you've decided on your character's two starting Experiences, record them in the Experience fields of your character sheet and assign +2 to both.

> **Tip:** If you're not sure what Experiences to take, consider the style of the campaign you're playing in and the actions you'll want to perform. In a standard, battle-focused campaign, it's never a bad idea to take your character's first Experience in something that will help with combat and the second Experience in something useful outside of combat.

### EXPERIENCE EXAMPLES

**Backgrounds:**  
*Assassin, Blacksmith, Bodyguard, Bounty Hunter, Chef to the Royal Family, Circus Performer, Con Artist, Fallen Monarch, Field Medic, High Priestess, Merchant, Noble, Pirate, Politician, Runaway, Scholar, Sellsword, Soldier, Storyteller, Thief, World Traveler*

**Characteristics:**  
*Affable, Battle-Hardened, Bookworm, Charming, Cowardly, Friend to All, Helpful, Intimidating Presence, Leader, Lone Wolf, Loyal, Observant, Prankster, Silver Tongue, Sticky Fingers, Stubborn to a Fault, Survivor, Young and Naive*

**Specialties:**  
*Acrobat, Gambler, Healer, Inventor, Magical Historian, Mapmaker, Master of Disguise, Navigator, Sharpshooter, Survivalist, Swashbuckler, Tactician*

**Skills:**  
*Animal Whisperer, Barter, Deadly Aim, Fast Learner, Incredible Strength, Liar, Light Feet, Negotiator, Photographic Memory, Quick Hands, Repair, Scavenger, Tracker*

**Phrases:**  
*Catch Me If You Can, Fake It Till You Make It, First Time's the Charm, Hold the Line, I Won't Let You Down, I'll Catch You, I've Got Your Back, Knowledge Is Power, Nature's Friend, Never Again, No One Left Behind, Pick on Someone Your Own Size, The Show Must Go On, This Is Not a Negotiation, Wolf in Sheep's Clothing*

### USING EXPERIENCES

When one of your character's Experiences fits the situation at hand, you can use that Experience to showcase their expertise. Before you make an action or reaction roll, you can spend a Hope to add the Experience's modifier to the roll's result. Sometimes more than one of your character's Experiences is a good fit for the situation (for example, if your character is trying to sneak past a guard in the dark, your *I Live in the Shadows* and *Stealthy* Experiences would both apply). If it fits the story, you can add more than one experience modifier to a roll, spending a Hope for each.

### CHANGING EXPERIENCES

Your character has the opportunity to gain new Experiences as they gain levels. However, if you discover that your character has outgrown a previous Experience or it doesn't feel right anymore, you're not stuck with the ones you've already chosen. For example, you might find that your character's *Stealthy* Experience no longer matches the head-on way they've learned to solve problems. Or perhaps your group likes to try to solve things diplomatically first, so your character's *Catch Them by Surprise* Experience isn't a good fit for the table's collaborative story. That's totally okay! Work with your GM to find Experiences that better align with your storytelling goals, and with the actions your character would be good at.

### STEP 8: CHOOSE YOUR DOMAIN CARDS

**Domains** are the core building blocks of Daggerheart's classes. The following domains are included in this book: Arcana, Blade, Bone, Codex, Grace, Midnight, Sage, Splendor, and Valor. Each domain has a **domain deck**—a deck of cards containing abilities and spells with a central theme or focus. For details on what each domain represents and how to use your domain cards, see the upcoming "Domains" section.

Each class in Daggerheart is formed by combining two of these domains—for example, the warrior class comprises Blade and Bone, the druid comprises Arcana and Sage, and the rogue comprises Midnight and Grace. This combination is noted at the top of the character sheet for each class, and the colors and symbols are found on the subclass foundation card.

To start, look at all the level 1 cards from your class's two domains and choose two cards, returning the rest to their respective decks. You can take one from each domain or two from a single domain, whichever you prefer. These cards grant you special spells and abilities; you'll choose another card each time you level up.

> **Tip:** All domain card text can also be found for reference on page 328.

#### SHARED DOMAINS

Each class shares its domains with at least one other class. For example, Blade is shared by the guardian and the warrior, Sage is shared by the druid and the ranger, and Grace is shared by the bard and the rogue. If a fellow player's class has the same domain as yours, we encourage you to coordinate with them and choose different cards from that domain deck (even if your group has multiple copies). This way, each player feels distinct and shines when they bring their unique abilities to the story. However, if the GM and players agree, feel free to make an exception. Sharing cards is common when more than one player chooses the same class or when three (or more) players share the same domain. As always, it comes down to open communication between the players and the GM. If you need extra copies of a card, you can download and print them at home.

### STEP 9: CREATE YOUR CONNECTIONS

You've almost finished creating your character! Now it's time to forge their **connections**. These represent the relationships and personal history between your character and their fellow party members.

Once your group is comfortable with their finished (or almost-finished) PCs, summarize your characters for each other. At minimum, share their name, pronouns, character description, Experiences, and the answers to the background questions—but feel free to include any details you'd like the other players to know.

Then work together to decide how your characters are connected and how they feel about each other. The Connections section of your character guide provides inspiration—we recommend you pick at least one question to ask another player for their character to answer—but you're welcome to create new questions. You can always turn down a question or relationship suggested by another player if it's not a good fit or not a relationship you're interested in exploring. While it's great to create connections with every character, it's perfectly okay if you're not sure about some of them yet—and you can always discover your relationships through play. These connections are a starting point to build on during the game.

After the party's connections are complete, you're ready to play! The rest of this chapter contains resources to use when building your character, such as information on domains, classes, ancestries, and communities. Chapter 2 then presents the rules you'll use to play Daggerheart.

## DOMAINS

*Domains are the core themes of each class. The combination of two domains forms the basis for each class's abilities and spells, which you gain from your domain cards. Near the end of character creation, you'll pick your first cards from your chosen class's domains.*

### ARCANA  
Arcana is the domain of innate and instinctual magic. Those who choose this path tap into the raw, enigmatic forces of the realms to manipulate both their own energy and the elements. Arcana offers wielders a volatile power, but it is incredibly potent when correctly channeled.

### BLADE  
Blade is the domain of weapon mastery. Whether by steel, bow, or perhaps a more specialized arm, those who follow this path have the skill to cut short the lives of others. Wielders of Blade dedicate themselves to achieving inexorable power over death.

### BONE  
Bone is the domain of tactics and the body. Practitioners of this domain have an uncanny control over their own physical abilities and an eye for predicting the behaviors of others in combat. Adherents to Bone gain an unparalleled understanding of bodies and their movements.

### CODEX  
Codex is the domain of intensive magical study. Those who seek magical knowledge turn to the equations of power recorded in books, written on scrolls, etched into walls, or tattooed on bodies. Codex offers a commanding and versatile understanding of magic to devotees who pursue knowledge beyond the boundaries of common wisdom.

### GRACE  
Grace is the domain of charisma. Through rapturous storytelling, charming spells, or a shroud of lies, those who channel this power define the realities of their adversaries, bending perception to their will. Grace offers its wielders raw magnetism and mastery over language.

### MIDNIGHT  
Midnight is the domain of shadows and secrecy. Whether by clever tricks, deft magic, or the cloak of night, those who channel these forces practice the art of obscurity and can uncover sequestered treasures. Midnight offers practitioners the power to control and create enigmas.

### SAGE  
Sage is the domain of the natural world. Those who walk this path tap into the unfettered power of the earth and its creatures to unleash raw magic. Sage grants its adherents the vitality of a blooming flower and the ferocity of a ravenous predator.

### SPLENDOR  
Splendor is the domain of life. Through this magic, followers gain the ability to heal and, to an extent, control death. Splendor offers its disciples the magnificent ability to both give and end life.

### VALOR  
Valor is the domain of protection. Whether through attack or defense, those who choose this discipline channel formidable strength to protect their allies in battle. Valor offers great power to those who raise their shields in defense of others.

## READING DOMAIN CARDS

During character creation and as your character levels up, you'll gain increasingly powerful **domain cards**, which provide features you can utilize during your adventures.

Some domain cards provide moves you can make, such as a unique attack or a spell. Others offer passive effects (which always apply while you hold that card), new abilities to use during downtime or social encounters, or even one-time benefits.

Each domain card includes five elements:

1. **Level:** The number in the top left of the card indicates the card's level. You can only choose domain cards of your level or lower.

2. **Domain:** Beneath the card's level there is a symbol indicating its domain. You can only choose cards from your class's domains.

3. **Recall Cost:** The number and lightning bolt in the top right of the card shows its Recall Cost. This doesn't affect you at character creation, but once you reach level 5, you'll have more cards than space in your loadout (your set of five active cards; see the "Loadout and Vault" section on page 101). You can normally only move an inactive card from your vault to your loadout during downtime, but you can mark a number of Stress equal to a card's Recall Cost to swap it immediately.

4. **Type:** The card's type is listed in the center above the title. There are three types of domain cards: abilities, spells, and grimoires. **Abilities** are typically mundane in nature, while **spells** are magical. **Grimoires** are unique to the Codex domain and are a collection of smaller spells bundled together. Some game mechanics only apply to certain types of cards.

5. **Feature:** The text on the bottom half of the card describes its feature, including any special rules you need to follow when you use that card.

## DOMAIN CARD REFERENCE

*[Note: This section would contain the full domain card reference from the appendix. Due to length constraints, I'm including a sample of the domain cards to show the format. The complete reference would include all domain cards from all domains.]*

### ARCANA DOMAIN

**RUNE WARD**  
_Level 1 Arcana Spell_  
_Recall Cost: 0_  
You have a deeply personal trinket that can be infused with protective magic and held as a ward by you or an ally. Describe what it is and why it's important to you. The ward's holder can spend a Hope to reduce incoming damage by **1d8**.  
If the Ward Die result is 8, the ward's power ends after it reduces damage this turn. It can be recharged for free on your next rest.

**UNLEASH CHAOS**  
_Level 1 Arcana Spell_  
_Recall Cost: 1_  
At the beginning of a session, place a number of tokens equal to your Spellcast trait on this card.  
Make a **Spellcast Roll** against a target within Far range and spend any number of tokens to channel raw energy from within yourself to unleash against them. On a success, roll a number of **d10s** equal to the tokens you spent and deal that much magic damage to the target.  
Mark a Stress to replenish this card with tokens (up to your Spellcast trait).  
At the end of each session, clear all unspent tokens.

**WALL WALK**  
_Level 1 Arcana Spell_  
_Recall Cost: 1_  
Spend a Hope to allow a creature you can touch to climb on walls and ceilings as easily as walking on the ground. This lasts until the end of the scene or you cast Wall Walk again.

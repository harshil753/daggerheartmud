# Level Up Rules

This file contains all rules related to leveling up characters and character progression in Daggerheart.

## Overview

All party members level up at the same time when the GM determines they've reached a milestone. Most groups play at least three sessions between levels. Characters begin at level 1 and progress to level 10.

## Tiers of Play

Levels are divided into four tiers:
- **Tier 1**: Level 1 only
- **Tier 2**: Levels 2-4
- **Tier 3**: Levels 5-7
- **Tier 4**: Levels 8-10

Tier affects damage thresholds, level achievements, equipment availability, and adversary difficulty.

## Level Up Process

### Step 1: Update Level
Record your new level on your character sheet.

### Step 2: Take Level Achievements
At certain levels, you automatically gain specific benefits:

**At Level 2:**
- Gain an additional Experience at +2
- Gain a permanent +1 bonus to Proficiency
- Fill in one Proficiency circle on your character sheet

**At Level 5:**
- Gain an additional Experience at +2
- Clear all marks on character traits (allows you to increase them again)
- Gain a permanent +1 bonus to Proficiency
- Fill in one Proficiency circle on your character sheet

**At Level 8:**
- Gain an additional Experience at +2
- Clear all marks on character traits (allows you to increase them again)
- Gain a permanent +1 bonus to Proficiency
- Fill in one Proficiency circle on your character sheet

### Step 3: Choose Two Advancement Options
Select any two unmarked options from your current or previous tier:

#### Available in Tier 2 (Levels 2-4)
- [ ] Gain +1 to two unmarked character traits and mark them
- [ ] Permanently gain one Hit Point slot
- [ ] Permanently gain one Stress slot
- [ ] Permanently gain +1 to two Experiences
- [ ] Choose an additional domain card (up to level 4)
- [ ] Permanently gain +1 to Evasion

#### Additional Options in Tier 3 (Levels 5-7)
All Tier 2 options plus:
- [ ] Take an upgraded subclass card (crosses out multiclass option)
- [ ] Increase Proficiency by +1 (requires both advancement slots)
- [ ] Multiclass into another class (requires both advancement slots, crosses out subclass upgrade)

#### Additional Options in Tier 4 (Levels 8-10)
All previous tier options available

### Step 4: Raise Damage Thresholds
Add +1 to both Major and Severe thresholds (you always add your current level to base thresholds).

### Step 5: Take a New Domain Card
Choose one domain card at your level or lower from any domain available to your class.

You may also trade out one domain card you already have for a different one of equal or lower level.

If you have more than 5 domain cards, choose which 5 to keep in your loadout and which to store in your vault.

## Advancement Option Details

### Increasing Character Traits
- Choose two unmarked character traits
- Gain permanent +1 to each
- Mark them (can't increase again until next tier clears marks)

### Adding Hit Points
- Darken the outline of the next Hit Point rectangle on your character sheet
- This permanently increases your maximum Hit Points

### Adding Stress
- Darken the outline of the next Stress rectangle on your character sheet
- This permanently increases your maximum Stress

### Increasing Experiences
- Choose two Experiences on your character sheet
- Gain permanent +1 to each

### Taking Domain Cards
- Choose from domains available to your class
- Must be at or below your current level
- If multiclassed, can choose from multiclass domain at half your level (rounded up)

### Increasing Evasion
- Gain permanent +1 to Evasion
- This makes you harder to hit

### Taking Upgraded Subclass Cards
- Take your subclass's Specialization card (if you have Foundation)
- Take your subclass's Mastery card (if you have Specialization)
- This uses BOTH advancement slots for the level
- Crosses out multiclass option for that tier

### Increasing Proficiency
- Uses BOTH advancement slots for the level
- Fill in one Proficiency circle
- Increase weapon damage dice by 1 (e.g., 2d6 becomes 3d6)

### Multiclassing
- Available starting at level 5
- Uses BOTH advancement slots for the level
- Crosses out one "take upgraded subclass card" option in that tier
- Crosses out other multiclass options (can only multiclass once)

## Multiclassing Rules

When you multiclass:
1. Choose an additional class
2. Take the multiclass module and add it to your character sheet
3. Choose one foundation card from a subclass of the new class
4. Select one domain from the new class
5. Gain access to the new class's class feature

### Multiclass Domain Cards
- Choose from the new class's domains at **half your current level** (rounded up)
- Example: Level 5 wizard multiclassing into druid can choose Sage domain cards up to level 3

### Multiclass Spellcast Trait
- If foundation card has Spellcast trait, you can use either it or your original
- If you didn't have Spellcast before, you must use the new one

### Using Multiclass Abilities
- All attacks, spells, and moves use your **current level**
- Half-level restriction only applies to **selecting domain cards**
- If a move asks for "dice equal to your level," use your character sheet level

### Restrictions
- Can only multiclass **once**
- Cannot gain Mastery card for any subclass
- Must cross out one subclass upgrade option

## Example Level Up

## Character Sheet Reference

The character sheet from the appendix (starting around line 22761) provides:
- Character trait tracking with circles to mark when increased
- Hit Point slots with dotted outlines to darken when gained
- Stress slots with dotted outlines to darken when gained
- Proficiency circles to fill in
- Experience sections
- Damage threshold calculations
- Active weapon and armor sections
- Domain card loadout and vault tracking

## Damage Thresholds Calculation

Your damage thresholds are always:
- **Major Threshold** = Armor Base Major + Current Level + Other Bonuses
- **Severe Threshold** = Armor Base Severe + Current Level + Other Bonuses

If unarmored:
- **Major Threshold** = Current Level
- **Severe Threshold** = Current Level × 2

## Equipment Upgrades

As you level up and enter new tiers, you gain access to better equipment:
- **Tier 1** (Level 1): Starting weapons and armor
- **Tier 2** (Levels 2-4): Improved weapons and armor with better features
- **Tier 3** (Levels 5-7): Advanced weapons and armor
- **Tier 4** (Levels 8-10): Legendary weapons and armor

Equipment availability is controlled by the GM based on the campaign and story.

## Proficiency and Damage

Proficiency determines how many damage dice you roll:
- Proficiency 1: Roll 1 damage die (e.g., 1d8)
- Proficiency 2: Roll 2 damage dice (e.g., 2d8)
- Proficiency 3: Roll 3 damage dice (e.g., 3d8)
- And so on...

You start with Proficiency 1 and gain +1 at levels 2, 5, and 8 automatically. You can also choose to increase it further as an advancement option.

## Domain Card Management

### Loadout vs Vault
- **Loadout**: Up to 5 active domain cards you can use
- **Vault**: Storage for cards not currently active

You can swap cards between loadout and vault during a long rest.

### Recall Cost
Many domain cards have a "Recall Cost" - the number of Hope you must spend to move them from your vault to your loadout during a rest.

## New Character at Mid-Campaign Level

If creating a new character to join an existing campaign:
1. Create character at the party's current level
2. Take all level achievements up to that level
3. Make advancement choices for each level
4. Select domain cards up to your level
5. Start with appropriate tier equipment (GM's discretion)

## Tips for Leveling Up

1. **Plan Ahead**: Think about your character's build and which advancements support it
2. **Coordinate with Party**: Discuss domain card selections if sharing domains
3. **Consider Multiclassing**: Plan which tier you might multiclass if interested
4. **Balance Offense and Defense**: Don't neglect Hit Points, Stress, and Evasion
5. **Match Character Arc**: Choose advancements that reflect your character's growth
6. **Update Everything**: Remember to update all derived values (thresholds, Evasion bonuses, etc.)

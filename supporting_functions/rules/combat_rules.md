# DAGGERHEART COMBAT RULES

## CHAPTER TWO: PLAYING AN ADVENTURE

### ARMED CONFLICT

When the party encounters a situation that requires them to fight, you enter **Armed Conflict**. This is the core of Daggerheart's combat system, where characters use their abilities, weapons, and magic to overcome adversaries.

#### The Flow of Combat

Combat in Daggerheart follows a structured flow:

1. **Initiative**: Determine the order of actions
2. **GM Turn**: The GM takes actions for all adversaries
3. **PC Turn**: Each player character takes one action
4. **Repeat**: Continue alternating until the conflict is resolved

#### Spotlight System

The **Spotlight** system determines who acts when. During a GM turn, you can spotlight any adversary by spending Fear. During a PC turn, each player character gets one action.

#### Fear and Hope

- **Fear**: GM resource used to spotlight adversaries and activate powerful abilities
- **Hope**: Player resource used to improve rolls and activate character abilities

### COMBAT MECHANICS

#### Action Rolls

When a character attempts an action in combat, they make an **Action Roll**:

1. Roll 2d12
2. Add relevant attribute modifier
3. Add any bonuses from equipment, abilities, or circumstances
4. Compare total to the target's Difficulty or the action's Difficulty

#### Success Levels

- **Critical Success**: Both dice show 12
- **Success**: Total meets or exceeds the target Difficulty
- **Failure**: Total is below the target Difficulty

#### Damage and Consequences

- **Hit Points (HP)**: Represent physical health and endurance
- **Stress**: Represents mental strain, fear, and exhaustion

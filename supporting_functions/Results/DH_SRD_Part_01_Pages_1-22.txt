marking a Stress. When you do, choose one trait to raise by +1 until 
you drop out of that Beastform.
BEASTFORM 
Mark a Stress  to magically transform into a creature of your tier or 
lower from the Beastform list. You can drop out of this form at any 
time. While transformed, you can’t use weapons or cast spells from 
domain cards, but you can still use other features or abilities you 
have access to. Spells you cast before you transform stay active and 
last for their normal duration, and you can talk and communicate as 
normal. Additionally, you gain the Beastform’s features, add their 
Evasion bonus to your Evasion, and use the trait specified in their 
statistics for your attack. While you’re in a Beastform, your armor 
becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as usual; when 
you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor Slots remain 
marked. If you mark your last Hit Point, you automatically drop out of 
this form.

Spend a Hope and make an attack against a target. On a

Hold Them Off: Spend 3 Hope  when you succeed on an attack

adversaries within range of the attack.

Companion Experience of your choice.
Light in the Dark:           
                                                                                                                         
Creature Comfort:  Once per rest, when you take time during 
a quiet moment to give your companion love and attention, 
you can gain a Hope or you can both clear a Stress.
Armored:  When your companion takes damage, you can 
mark one of your Armor Slots  instead of marking one of 
their Stress.
Vicious:  Increase your companion’s damage dice or range  
by one step (d6 to d8, Close to Far, etc.).
Resilient: Your companion gains an additional Stress slot.
Bonded:  When you mark your last Hit Point, your companion 
rushes to your side to comfort you. Roll a number of d6s 
equal to the unmarked Stress slots they have and mark 
them. If any roll a 6, your companion helps you up. Clear your 
last Hit Point and return to the scene.

When you command your companion to attack, 
they gain any benefits that would normally only 
apply to you (such as the effects of “Ranger’s

your Proficiency and their damage die. TRAINING
When your companion would take any amount 
of damage, they mark a Stress. When they 
mark their last Stress, they drop out of the 
scene (by hiding, fleeing, or a similar action). 
They remain unavailable until the start of 
your next long rest, where they return with 
1 Stress cleared.
When you choose a downtime move that 
clears Stress on yourself, your companion 
clears an equal number of Stress.When your character levels up, choose one available option 
for your companion from the following list and mark it here.

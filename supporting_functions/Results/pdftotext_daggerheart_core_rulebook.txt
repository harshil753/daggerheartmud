INTRODUCTION
Welcome to Daggerheart
Daggerheart is a collaborative fantasy roleplaying game of incredible magic and heroic
adventure. During your journeys, you may find yourself rubbing elbows with nobles to
investigate and stop an assassination plot, delving into an ancient dungeon to prevent an
apocalyptic creature from breaking free, sailing across a vast ocean to face a terrifying sea
monster, or preventing a precious relic from falling into the hands of a dangerous enemy. No
matter the adventure your party embarks upon, Daggerheart provides the tools to tell a story
that is both heartfelt and epic.

Character Creation
Unless you’re the GM, the first step of Daggerheart is to create your character. In addition to
choosing their class, community, and ancestry, you’re also responsible for crafting their physical
appearance, personality, and prior experience, as well as their relationships with the other
characters. Some of these decisions are purely narrative, meaning they only appear in the game
through your roleplaying, but others are mechanical choices that affect the actions you’re more
(or less) likely to succeed at when rolling your dice.

GETTING STARTED
Before you create your character, discuss the campaign with your table and begin brainstorming ideas.
  Tip: There are many mechanics mentioned in the Character Creation section that will be fully covered in chapter 2.

   HAVE A SESSION ZERO                                                THINK ABOUT CHARACTER CONCEPTS

STEP 1:

The first step of character creation is to choose the class you want to play. Each class is a role-based archetype that determines
what abilities you have access to throughout the campaign. For example, you might choose to play a guardian if you want to be
the “tank” of your group who runs into fights headfirst and protects others with their own life. You might choose to be a wizard if
you want to cast unique spells to solve problems, heal party members, and wield cunning battle magic.
Once you’ve chosen a class, you’ll also choose a subclass.
The subclasses are subsets of each class that further define
your character’s archetype.

(even if your group has multiple copies). This way, each player
feels distinct and shines when they bring their unique abilities
to the story. However, if the GM and players agree, feel free to
make an exception. Sharing cards is common when more than

players share the same domain. As always, it comes down to
open communication between the players and the GM. If you
need extra copies of a card, you can download and print them
at home.

Domains are the core themes of each class. The combination of two domains forms the basis for each
class’s abilities and spells, which you gain from your domain cards. Near the end of character creation,
you’ll pick your first cards from your chosen class’s domains.

 24    Chapter 1: Domains
READING DOMAIN CARDS
During character creation and as your character levels up, you’ll gain increasingly powerful domain cards, which provide
features you can utilize during your adventures.
Some domain cards provide moves you can make, such as a unique attack or a spell. Others offer passive effects (which always
apply while you hold that card), new abilities to use during downtime or social encounters, or even one-time benefits.
Each domain card includes five elements:
1. Level: The number in the top left of the card indicates the
   card’s level. You can only choose domain cards of your
   level or lower.                                                  1                                                      3
2. Domain: Beneath the card’s level there is a symbol
   indicating its domain. You can only choose cards from your
   class’s domains.
                                                                    2
3. Recall Cost: The number and lightning bolt in the top right
   of the card shows its Recall Cost. This doesn’t affect you
   at character creation, but once you reach level 5, you’ll
                                                                    4
   have more cards than space in your loadout (your set of
   five active cards; see the “Loadout and Vault” section on
   page 101). You can normally only move an inactive card
   from your vault to your loadout during downtime, but you
                                                                                                                           5
   can mark a number of Stress equal to a card’s Recall Cost
   to swap it immediately.
4. Type: The card’s type is listed in the center above the
   title. There are three types of domain cards: abilities,
   spells, and grimoires. Abilities are typically mundane in
   nature, while spells are magical. Grimoires are unique to
   the Codex domain and are a collection of smaller spells
   bundled together. Some game mechanics only apply to
   certain types of cards.
5. Feature: The text on the bottom half of the card describes
   its feature, including any special rules you need to follow
   when you use that card.




  26      Chapter 1: Domains
Class
This section details each of Daggerheart’s
classes. Your chosen class grants the
following:
   Domains: Each class lists the two domains that serve
   as the basis for its abilities. You can choose cards from
   these domain decks during character creation and when
   leveling up.
   Starting Evasion: Each class has its own starting Evasion.
   Starting Hit Points: Each class has its own amount of
   starting Hit Points.
   Class Items: Each class has a unique set of starter items.
   Class Feature: Each class has a unique class feature (or set
   of features).
   Class Hope Feature: Each class has a special move they
   can make by spending 3 Hope.

Your chosen subclass grants the following:
   Spellcast Trait: If you’re a spellcaster, this is the
   character trait your subclass uses any time you make
   a Spellcast Roll.
   Foundation Feature: The foundation feature is the
   unique starting feature that establishes the identity
   and strengths of the subclass.
   Specialization Feature: The specialization feature
   is a more advanced feature (or set of features) you
   can gain when you level up. For some subclasses, the
   specialization feature is a new ability; for others, it
   expands the abilities of the class or foundation feature,
   making it even more potent.
   Mastery Feature: The mastery feature is your
   subclass’s most powerful feature, which you can gain
   at higher levels. For some subclasses, the mastery
   feature unlocks an extraordinary new ability; for
   others, it’s the impressive culmination of their
   subclass’s core feature.
The foundation, specialization, and mastery
features each come with a card that you can
choose to take as one of the benefits from
leveling up. The cards hold information
about the feature for quick reference.
The following class sections refer to many
mechanics and terms that will be taught
throughout chapter 2. Use the index to
navigate to these concepts as needed.

SERAPH
Seraphs are divine fighters and healers imbued with sacred
purpose. A wide array of deities exist within the realms, and thus
numerous kinds of seraphs are appointed by these gods. Their
ethos traditionally aligns with the domain or goals of their god,
such as defending the weak, exacting vengeance, protecting a
land or artifact, or upholding a particular faith. Some seraphs
ally themselves with an army or locale, much to the satisfaction
of their rulers, but other crusaders fight in opposition to the        SERAPH

CLANK
Clanks are sentient mechanical beings built from a variety
of materials, including metal, wood, and stone. They can
resemble humanoids, animals, or even inanimate objects. Like
organic beings, their bodies come in a wide array of sizes.
Because of their bespoke construction, many clanks have
highly specialized physical configurations. Examples include
clawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in
weaponry.
Many clanks embrace body modifications for style as well as
function, and members of other ancestries often turn to clank
artisans to construct customized mobility aids and physical
adornments. Other ancestries can create clanks, even using
their own physical characteristics as inspiration, but it’s also
common for clanks to build one another. A clank’s lifespan
extends as long as they’re able to acquire or craft new parts,
making their physical form effectively immortal. That said,
their minds are subject to the effects of time, and deteriorate

DWARF
Dwarves are most easily recognized as short humanoids
with square frames, dense musculature, and thick hair.
Their average height ranges from 4 to 5 ½ feet, and they
are often broad in proportion to their stature. Their skin and
nails contain a high amount of keratin, making them naturally
resilient. This allows dwarves to embed gemstones into their
bodies and decorate themselves with tattoos or piercings.
Their hair grows thickly—usually on their heads, but some
dwarves have thick hair across their bodies as well. Dwarves
of all genders can grow facial hair, which they often style in
elaborate arrangements. Typically, dwarves live up to 250
years of age, maintaining their muscle mass well into later life.

   ANCESTRY FEATURES
Thick Skin: When you take Minor damage, you can mark 2

                           ELF
                           Elves are typically tall humanoids with pointed ears and acutely
                           attuned senses. Their ears vary in size and pointed shape, and as
                           they age, the tips begin to droop. While elves come in a wide range
                           of body types, they are all fairly tall, with heights ranging from
                           about 6 to 6 ½ feet. All elves have the ability to drop into a celestial
                           trance, rather than sleep. This allows them to rest effectively in a
                           short amount of time.
                           Some elves possess what is known as a “mystic form,” which
                           occurs when an elf has dedicated themself to the study or
                           protection of the natural world so deeply that their physical form
                           changes. These characteristics can include celestial freckles, the
                           presence of leaves, vines, or flowers in their hair, eyes that flicker
                           like fire, and more. Sometimes these traits are inherited from
                           parents, but if an elf changes their environment or magical focus,
                           their appearance changes over time. Because elves live for about
                           350 years, these traits can shift more than once throughout their

FAERIE
Faeries are winged humanoid creatures with insectile features.
These characteristics cover a broad spectrum from humanoid
to insectoid—some possess additional arms, compound eyes,
lantern organs, chitinous exoskeletons, or stingers. Because of
their close ties to the natural world, they also frequently possess
attributes that allow them to blend in with various plants. The
average height of a faerie ranges from about 2 feet to 5 feet,
but some faeries grow up to 7 feet tall. All faeries possess
membranous wings and they each go through a process of
metamorphosis. The process and changes differ from faerie to
faerie, but during this transformation each individual manifests
the unique appearance they will carry throughout the rest of their
approximately 50-year lifespan.

   ANCESTRY FEATURE

                           pupils, and cloven hooves. Though their appearances may
                           vary, most fauns have a humanoid torso and a goatlike lower
                           body covered in dense fur. Faun faces can be more caprine or
                           more humanlike, and they have a wide variety of ear and horn
                           shapes. Faun horns range from short with minimal curvature
                           to much larger with a distinct curl. The average faun ranges
                           from 4 feet to 6 ½ feet tall, but their height can change
                           dramatically from one moment to the next based on their
                           stance. The majority of fauns have proportionately long limbs,
                           no matter their size or shape, and are known for their ability
                           to deliver powerful blows with their split hooves. Fauns live
                           for roughly 225 years, and as they age, their appearance can
                           become increasingly goatlike.

from a tiny 2 feet tall to a staggering 7 feet tall. While the
common lifespan of a fungril is about 300 years, some have
been reported to live much longer. They can communicate

choose to decorate their tusks with significant ornamentation.
Orcs typically live for 125 years, and unless altered, their tusks
continue to grow throughout the course of their lives. Their ears

Families within the world of Daggerheart are as unique as the
peoples and cultures that inhabit it. Anyone’s appearance and skill
set can be shaped by blood, magic, proximity, or a variety of other
factors.
If you decide that your character is a descendant of multiple
ancestries and you want to mechanically represent that in the
game, use the steps below:

   STEP 1: DETERMINE ANCESTRY COMBINATION
   When you choose an ancestry at character creation, write down
   how your character identifies themself in the Heritage section
   of your character sheet. For example, your ancestry could be
   “goblin-orc,” or just “goblin” (with orc in their lineage), or a
   name you choose, like “toothling.”                                                         FUNGRIL-GALAPA
                                                                                               "SHROOMSHELL"
   STEP 2: CHOOSE ANCESTRY FEATURES
   Work with your GM to choose two features from the ancestries
   in your character’s lineage.
You must choose the first feature from one ancestry and the
second from another. Write both down on a notecard you can keep
with your other cards or next to your character sheet. For example,
if you are making a goblin-orc, you might take the “Surefooted” and
“Tusks” features or the “Sturdy” and “Danger Sense” features. You
                                                                      FAERIE-SIMIAH
can’t take both the “Surefooted” and “Sturdy” features.               "FLITTERIN"
If your character's heritage includes more
than two ancestries, you only choose
features from two. You can represent
additional ancestries through their
appearance or backstory.




                                                                                      Chapter 1: Ancestry      71
Community
Communities represent the culture or environment your character grew up in. Though a
character might have been a member of numerous communities during their upbringing, this
choice represents the one they feel had the most influence over their personality and current
skill set.
As with ancestries, describing the characteristics of a            When you build your character, you can draw inspiration from

HIGHBORNE
Being part of a highborne community means you're accustomed to
a life of elegance, opulence, and prestige within the upper echelons
of society. Traditionally, members of a highborne community
possess incredible material wealth. While this can take a variety
of forms depending on the community—including gold and other
minerals, land, or controlling the means of production—this status
always comes with power and influence. Highborne place great
value on titles and possessions, and there is little social mobility
within their ranks. Members of a highborne community often
control the political and economic status of the areas in which they
live due to their ability to influence people and the economy with
their substantial wealth. The health and safety of the less affluent
people who live in these locations often hinges on the ability of this
highborne ruling class to prioritize the well-being of their subjects
over profit.
Highborne are often amiable, candid, conniving, enterprising,
ostentatious, and unflappable.

   COMMUNITY FEATURE
Privilege: You have advantage on rolls to consort with nobles,
negotiate prices, or leverage your reputation to get what you want.

                            Being part of a loreborne community means you’re from a
                            society that favors strong academic or political prowess.
                            Loreborne communities highly value knowledge, frequently
                            in the form of historical preservation, political advancement,
                            scientific study, skill development, or lore and mythology

                            few thrive in gathering information from the natural world.
                            Some may be isolationists, operating in smaller enclaves,
                            schools, or guilds and following their own unique ethos.
                            Others still wield their knowledge on a larger scale, making
                            deft political maneuvers across governmental landscapes.
                            Loreborne are often direct, eloquent, inquisitive, patient,
                            rhapsodic, and witty.

74   Chapter 1: Community
ORDERBORNE
Being part of an orderborne community
means you’re from a collective that
focuses on discipline or faith, and you
uphold a set of principles that reflect
your experience there. Orderborne are
frequently some of the most powerful
among the surrounding communities.
By aligning the members of their society
around a common value or goal, such as
a god, doctrine, ethos, or even a shared
business or trade, the ruling bodies
of these enclaves are able to mobilize
larger populations with less effort.
While orderborne communities take a
variety of forms—some even profoundly
pacifistic—perhaps the most feared
are those that structure themselves
around military prowess. In such a case,
it’s not uncommon for orderborne to
provide soldiers for hire to other cities or
countries.
Orderborne are often ambitious,
benevolent, pensive, prudent, sardonic,
and stoic.

RIDGEBORNE
Being part of a ridgeborne community means you’ve called the rocky peaks and sharp cliffs of the mountainside home. Those
who’ve lived in the mountains often consider themselves hardier than most because they’ve thrived among the most dangerous
terrain many continents have to offer. These groups are adept at adaptation, developing unique technologies and equipment
to move both people and products across difficult terrain. As such, ridgeborne grow up scrambling and climbing, making them
sturdy and strong-willed. Ridgeborne localities appear in a variety of forms—some cities carve out entire cliff faces, others
construct castles of stone, and still more live in small homes on windblown peaks. Outside forces often struggle to attack
ridgeborne groups, as the small militias and large military forces of the mountains are adept at utilizing their high-ground
advantage.
Ridgeborne are often bold, hardy, indomitable, loyal, reserved, and stubborn.

   COMMUNITY FEATURE
Steady: You have advantage on rolls to traverse dangerous
cliffs and ledges, navigate harsh environments, and use your
survival knowledge.




  76      Chapter 1: Community
SEABORNE
Being part of a seaborne community means you lived on or near a large body of water. Seaborne
communities are built, both physically and culturally, around the specific waters they call home.
Some of these groups live along the shore, constructing ports for locals and travelers alike. These
harbors function as centers of commerce, tourist attractions, or even just a safe place to lay
down one’s head after weeks of travel. Other seaborne live on the water in small boats or large
ships, with the idea of “home” comprising a ship and its crew, rather than any one landmass.
No matter their exact location, seaborne communities are closely tied to the ocean tides and the
creatures who inhabit them. Seaborne learn to fish at a young age, and train from birth to hold
their breath and swim in even the most tumultuous waters. Individuals from these groups are
highly sought after for their sailing skills, and many become captains of vessels, whether within
their own community, working for another, or even at the helm of a powerful naval operation.
Seaborne are often candid, cooperative, exuberant, fierce, resolute, and weathered.

   COMMUNITY FEATURE
Know the Tide: You can sense the ebb and flow of life. When you roll with Fear, place a token
on your community card. You can hold a number of tokens equal to your level. Before you make
an action roll, you can spend any number of these tokens to gain a +1 bonus to the roll for each
token spent. At the end of each session, clear all unspent tokens.




                                                                                                      Chapter 1: Community   77
SLYBORNE
Being part of a slyborne community means you come from a group
that operates outside the law, including all manner of criminals,
grifters, and con artists. Members of slyborne communities are
brought together by their disreputable goals and their clever means of
achieving them. Many people in these communities have an array of
unscrupulous skills: forging, thievery, smuggling, and violence. People
of any social class can be slyborne, from those who have garnered
vast wealth and influence to those without a coin to their name. To
the outside eye, slyborne might appear to be ruffians with no loyalty,
but these communities possess some of the strictest codes of honor
which, when broken, can result in a terrifying end for the transgressor.
Slyborne are often calculating, clever, formidable, perceptive, shrewd,
and tenacious.

   COMMUNITY FEATURE
Scoundrel: You have advantage on rolls to negotiate with criminals,
detect lies, or find a safe place to hide.




  78      Chapter 1: Community
UNDERBORNE
Being part of an underborne community means you’re from a subterranean society. Many
underborne live right beneath the cities and villages of other collectives, while some live much
deeper. These communities range from small family groups in burrows to massive metropolises
in caverns of stone. In many locales, underborne are recognized for their incredible boldness and
skill that enable great feats of architecture and engineering. Underborne are regularly hired for
their bravery, as even the least daring among them has likely encountered formidable belowground
beasts, and learning to dispatch such creatures is common practice amongst these societies.
Because of the dangers of their environment, many underborne communities develop unique
nonverbal languages that prove equally useful on the surface.
Underborne are often composed, elusive, indomitable, innovative, resourceful, and unpretentious.

   COMMUNITY FEATURE
Low-Light Living: When you’re in an area with low light or heavy shadow, you have advantage on
rolls to hide, investigate, or perceive details within that area.

                            WANDERBORNE
                            Being part of a wanderborne community means you’ve lived as
                            a nomad, forgoing a permanent home and experiencing a wide
                            variety of cultures. Unlike many communities that are defined
                            by their locale, wanderborne are defined by their traveling
                            lifestyle. Because of their frequent migration, wanderborne
                            put less value on the accumulation of material possessions in
                            favor of acquiring information, skills, and connections. While
                            some wanderborne are allied by a common ethos, such as a
                            religion or a set of political or economic values, others come
                            together after shared tragedy, such as the loss of their home
                            or land. No matter the reason, the dangers posed by life on
                            the road and the choice to continue down that road together
                            mean that wanderborne are known for their unwavering
                            loyalty.
                            Wanderborne are often inscrutable, magnanimous, mirthful,
                            reliable, savvy, and unorthodox.

WILDBORNE
Being part of a wildborne community means you lived deep within the forest. Wildborne communities are defined by their
dedication to the conservation of their homelands, and many have strong religious or cultural ties to the fauna they live among.
This results in unique architectural and technological advancements that favor sustainability over short-term, high-yield results.
It is a hallmark of wildborne societies to integrate their villages and cities with the natural environment and avoid disturbing the
lives of the plants and animals. While some construct their lodgings high in the branches of trees, others establish their homes
on the ground beneath the forest canopy. It’s not uncommon for wildborne to remain reclusive and hidden within their woodland
homes.
Wildborne are often hardy, loyal, nurturing, reclusive, sagacious, and vibrant.

When roleplaying, you’re encouraged to include descriptions
that go beyond appearance. Blind/VI people do not inherently
have heightened smell or hearing, but these senses can
inform them about their environment. Think about an area’s
scent, temperature, wind flow, and more. Describe obstacles,
people, and enemies in relation to their current position,
such as stating that someone is “several paces in front” of a
character or referencing a clock face or compass (where the
character is always standing in the middle).
Above all, don’t be afraid to play a blind/VI character and open
yourself up to these roleplaying opportunities, experiences,
and perspectives.

CHAPTER TWO:
PLAYING AN ADVENTURE
In this chapter, we’ll cover what you need to know as a player
to start your adventure, including the core mechanics, combat,
leveling up, equipment, and a few optional rules you can add to
your game.

Flow of the Game
In a session of Daggerheart, you and the other players go around the table describing
what your characters do in the fictional circumstances that the GM sets up, building on
each other’s ideas and working together to tell an exciting story. The mechanics of the
game help facilitate this conversation, providing structure to the discussion and a way
to resolve moments when there are several exciting possibilities for what happens next.
Everyone at the table should ask questions and integrate the answers into the game.
As a player, you’ll often ask clarifying questions about the scene: “Are there any guards
outside the door?” or “What kind of weapon are they holding?” or “Can I jump across
the gap safely?” The GM might answer questions directly: “There are four guards
outside the door,” or “They’re weilding longswords.” They might also ask you to roll to
determine the answer: “It’s raining and dark, so let’s see how well you jump the gap.
Give me an Agility Roll, Difficulty 11.”
In turn, the GM asks you questions and builds on those answers to create the fiction:
“How are you able to sneak around this building so carefully?” or “What does the
camp you’ve set up look like?” or “You’ve found a way to safely scramble up the wall—
what made your climb easier than you anticipated?” This back and forth creates a
collaborative conversation where everyone can meaningfully contribute to the fiction.
For those familiar with roleplaying games, the flow of the game might come naturally,
but if you’re new to this experience, it might not. The following steps outline an
example of the gameplay loop that drives every session. This gameplay loop will be
described in more detail in the upcoming sections.

Stress from Moves
Certain moves require you to mark Stress. Unless an effect
states otherwise, you can’t mark Stress multiple times on
the same feature to increase or repeat its effects (see the
“Spending Resources” section on page 107).
You can’t use a move that requires you to mark Stress if you
don’t have slots to mark.

physical damage to a creature with physical resistance, the
creature only takes 13 physical damage.
If multiple features grant the same kind of resistance, they
only count as one source of resistance. For example, if two
different spells both provide a character resistance to physical
damage, incoming damage is still only halved.
When a creature has immunity to a damage type, they do not
take any damage from an attack that deals damage of that type.
If your character has resistance or immunity plus another way

resistance or immunity first. You can then use other methods
to reduce the damage further. If an attack deals both
physical and magic damage, you can only benefit
from resistance or immunity if you are resistant

When you start a rest, you can swap cards between your
loadout and your vault. You must do so before you use any
downtime moves. If you have fewer than five cards in your
loadout, you can add cards from your vault to your loadout
until you have five active cards.
When you’re not resting, you can still swap cards into your
loadout, but it’s stressful to do so! To immediately switch a
card from your vault to your loadout, mark a number of Stress
equal to the vaulted card’s Recall Cost (located in the top right
of the card next to the lightning bolt symbol). When you do,
switch it for another domain card in your loadout and place
that card into your vault. If you currently have fewer than five
domain cards in your loadout, you can pay the Recall Cost and
place a card from your vault into your loadout without trading
out a card for it.

Swapping When You Level Up
If your loadout is full when you level up and gain a new card,
you can immediately move one of your active cards into your
vault and add the new card to your loadout at no cost.

DEATH
Facing death is an important part of being an adventurer and having a character die can be an exciting end to a story, as well as
an opportunity for the player to transition into something new. In Daggerheart, when you mark your last Hit Point, you must
make a death move.

Leveling Up
When your party reaches a milestone in a campaign, the GM will tell you that it’s time to level
up. How often this happens is up to your GM and your group’s narrative preferences, but most
groups play at least three sessions between levels.

Next, you have a set list of options for upgrading your character. You can choose any two options with unmarked slots. Some
options have multiple slots, meaning they can be chosen more than once. When you choose your advancement, mark the
appropriate slot. Once all of an option’s slots have been marked, you can’t take that option again.
    Then work with the GM to generate two starting Experiences for your character.

Arrows & Ammunition
We assume that if your character has a bow, they’re well supplied with standard arrows. If you have a gun, they're well supplied
with standard bullets of the applicable type. But if they've picked up specialized ammunition at some point, be prepared to keep
track of this limited arsenal.
  Tip: Your party might want to play a campaign that feels grounded or gritty. If so, you can monitor and limit the acquisition of
  supplies such as food, ammunition, and other sundries. Have a discussion with your GM and table about the cost of goods and the
  availability of materials in your world.

USING ARMOR
Each armor in this book includes its name, base damage thresholds, and base Armor Score. Some armor also has a feature.
For example, the chainmail starting armor has the following statistics:

 Wheelchair


Heavy Frame Models
These wheelchairs have bulky and heavier frames, allowing the chair to lend its weight to your character’s attacks. It also makes
them a bigger target.

Arcane Frame Models
These wheelchairs have frames that are attuned to your character and their magic, allowing them to channel their spells through
the chair. Unlike other primary magic weapons, the arcane-frame model doesn’t specify a trait to use when making an attack
with it. Instead, you use the Spellcast trait indicated by your subclass.

QUESTIONS TO
CONSIDER FOR GMS
 • Aliyah’s roll with Hope to finish off the Skeleton Knight meant
   that the PCs would have been able to act again before the
   archers. Those archers hadn’t taken any damage, but Stella
   described them falling apart after the knight died. Do you feel
   like that was a satisfying end to the combat, or would you
   have had the archers keep fighting? The explanation Stella
   offered to Rune could be taken as precedent, so if Stella
   chooses to not end a fight early in the future when the party
   destroys the most powerful skeleton, she’ll want to have
   an idea in mind why things are different the second time to
   maintain the integrity of the story.
 • Stella allowed Rune to make two jumps using the “Arcane Door”
   spell rather than making him roll for each casting. When a
   character is using an ability like that, do you want to call for a roll
   for each use or let one roll represent chaining the ability a couple
   of times like Stella did?
 • Would you have chosen to use “Terrifying” when the Skeleton
   Knight hit Tabby with “Dig Two Graves?” You don’t always have to
   use every one of an adversary’s features, and Stella skipped it to
   honor Tabby’s critical success.
 • In the fight with the skeletons, would you have had them attack
   the group in the order and fashion that Stella did? Choosing
   which adversaries to spotlight—and when—helps determine
   the shape of the fight and its rhythm, the ups and downs. How
   else could that fight have gone? Would you have waited to use
   the archers until after the Skeleton Knight?
 • Rune destroyed all four skeleton minions in one good hit, which
   meant the attack on the other skeletons was wasted. Would
   you have allowed Rune to use that other “Wild Flame” attack
   to attack the Skeleton twice, or maybe to hit one of the archers
   even though they were out of range? Or does losing the extra
   attack seem like a fair price for the certainty of being able to
   remove the minions?
 • What would you have done if Shepherd had rolled a success
   with Fear when using their “Nature’s Tongue” spell to talk to
   the goat? What would have been an interesting consequence if
   Shepherd failed that roll entirely? Would the goat have run off,
   or would you have introduced another complication during their
   ascent? Is there some complication that Stella could have used
   to foreshadow the skeletons or the wraith? Or would it have been
   better to gain a Fear and let the players keep pressing forward
   without an immediate consequence?

As you consider your answers to these questions and make
rulings during the game, you’ll develop your own GM style. That’s
the key point to take away from this: there is no right answer.
It all comes down to your group and what creates the best
experience for your table. Your GM style might even change over
time, and that’s okay, too. Next up is chapter 3, which will give
you the tools you need to run a great game for your players.

CHAPTER THREE
Running an adventure
This chapter is only required reading if you plan to be the game
master for a session or campaign of Daggerheart. If you’re reading
the book to create and play a character, you’ve reached the end of
what you need to know. If you’re a game master, read on!

introduction
As a game master, you are responsible for guiding the narrative and playing as the world
that exists around your PCs. You are the massive sandstorm that hinders their journey,
the innkeeper they befriend while seeking shelter, the mysterious stranger in the corner
who asks them for help, or anything else that comes up during a session. Being a GM can
be one of the most fun, exhilarating, and fulfilling experiences at the table—but it can
also be intimidating, especially when you’re learning a new system.
Parts of this chapter are much more conversational than the rest of the book. The
previous chapters were primarily focused on delivering the mechanics of the game; while
we’re going to cover mechanics in this chapter as well, we’re also going to talk about
topics that lend themselves much better to a conversation than hard-and-fast rules:
aspects of gameplay like story structure, improv, and world-building. Because, at the
end of the day, the “big secret” about GMing is that you aren’t bound by a rigid ruleset
like the players—you get to make it all up. Whether you made it up the week before, the
day before, or in the moment at the table, you’re always crafting an experience for your
players through the decisions you make.
This chapter is dedicated to giving you the tools you need to run a game of Daggerheart:
understanding the core mechanics; creating memorable encounters; planning exciting
sessions; knowing how to select, create, and use GM moves; crafting a full campaign;
running dynamic NPCs; and more.


Core Guidance
In this section, you’ll find some core guidance on how to run Daggerheart:
 • GM Principles
 • GM Best Practices
 • Pitfalls To Avoid
These three sections provide a foundation to help you get the most out of this game.
The “GM Principles” are your guiding star—when in doubt, return to these principles.
The “GM Best Practices” provide examples for you to follow, while “Pitfalls to
Avoid” shows you what to stay away from when GMing Daggerheart.
  As you read, don’t forget “The Golden Rule” on page 7.
Whether you are a first-time GM, a veteran behind the screen,
or anything in between, we encourage you to embrace the
parts of this chapter that resonate with you and modify
portions that don’t.

   AVOID UNDERMINING SUCCESS
On a success with Fear, one pitfall GMs can run into is
undermining their players’ success when making a GM move
as the consequence. For example, if a PC makes a Finesse roll
in an attempt to move stealthily through a hallway, and they
succeed but roll with Fear, don’t use your move to sound an
alarm bell or make someone bump into them, spoiling their
cover. The PC succeeded on the roll, and that success should
be honored, even if it comes with a consequence. Instead,
consider options such as introducing a new obstacle at their
target destination or adding a new enemy approaching from
behind to complicate their situation.
Similarly, if a PC does something cool—such as cleverly
casting a spell—let them enjoy it instead of immediately
foiling their schemes and let the scene play out for a while,
using moves to change and escalate the scenario rather than
end the effect. For example, a PC might circumvent a trap
you laid; rather than immediately use a GM move to spring
the trap into working, let the PC feel smart as you instead
use your next GM move to summon more foes or telegraph
what other dangers might be on the path ahead. Use your GM
moves to immediately shut down an effect when it involves a
climactic moment or a powerful adversary—when you need
to show that the situation is dire.
Keep this principle in mind as you make GM moves. The
following sections provide advice on what kind of moves
you can make and how to implement harder moves with
care. After all, not every move will be enjoyed in every
circumstance. If the PCs are delivering a powerful artifact to
a wizard to be destroyed, having a minor adversary steal the
artifact can spark an exciting story arc—or it can throw icy
water on the party’s excitement and make them feel all their
work to retrieve it was pointless. As always, communication
and collaboration are key, and hard actions shouldn’t negate
player agency or feel punishing.

   SOFTER AND HARDER MOVES
When play turns to you, you have many options for how to
respond. Some are soft moves that are generally easier on the
players—they give the party new information about the scene
and offer them an opportunity to react to it. Others are hard
moves that are usually harsher, bigger, or more direct—this
fiction happens without allowing PCs to intercede. Consider
using softer moves on failures with Hope and harder moves on
any roll with Fear. Additionally, you might start off a session
using softer moves and progress into harder moves as the
story comes to a climax. Remember that your moves set the
tone for a challenge or threat.
  The next section contains example moves in approximate
  order of severity.

   SHIFT THE ENVIRONMENT
You can change the environment the PCs are navigating to raise the

the PCs in a fun and engaging way—maybe the rope bridge they’re
crossing suddenly snaps or a river sweeps them off their feet.
Perhaps an angry crowd packs the marketplace, obscuring the
person they’re following, or a building falls toward the PCs after
being struck with a spell that missed its target.

Here is a rough guide of how much Fear you might want to spend in a given scene depending on its role in the story:

 Scene Type          Example Scenes                                                                Amount of Fear Spent

 Incidental          A catch-up between PCs after an emotionally charged scene; gathering                      0–1 Fear
                     information; resupplying at a local market; resting during downtime.

 Minor               A travel sequence; a minor skirmish that introduces new foes or signals                   1–3 Fear
                     future trouble.

 Standard            A substantial battle with a notable objective; perilous travel that tests                 2–4 Fear
                     might and wit; a tense social encounter seeking crucial information or
                     aid.

 Major               A large battle with a Solo or Leader adversary; a character-defining                      4–8 Fear
                     scene with a significant change to a character’s personal story (such as
                     revelation, growth, and betrayal).

 Climactic           A major confrontation with the villain of a story arc; an epic set piece                 6–12 Fear
                     battle; a judicial duel to determine an important NPC’s fate.


What Do I Do with All This Fear?
If you find yourself coming into a battle with a large amount of Fear (especially over 10), consider the following approaches:

SETTING ROLL DIFFICULTY
When a player makes an action roll, you’ll often have to set the
Difficulty of that challenge to know whether they’ve succeeded
or failed. Setting a target number for Difficulty can feel like it
relies on a lot of factors, but it’s best not to overcomplicate
the question: how hard is the task they’re trying to accomplish
in this scene? Use the following rubric as a general guideline
when setting Difficulty.


     5         10          15        20         25         30
    VERY       EASY      AVERAGE     HARD       VERY      NEARLY
    EASY                                        HARD    IMPOSSIBLE


                      Difficulty doesn’t need to be a multiple of
                      5, so feel free to choose numbers between
                      two of the rubric options. Additionally,
                      while most Difficulties fall between 5 and
                      30, you can select numbers outside that
                      range to fit the story. You can choose to
                      keep this Difficulty secret or tell the player
                      what they’re aiming for up front; both
                      playstyles work well in Daggerheart.

   DEGREES OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE
Often, instead of setting a single value for success, you might
instead give a player different outcomes based on the relative
success or failure of their roll This tactic is especially useful
on rolls to inspect an area, recall something from the past,
or persuade an NPC to surrender information. Simply pick a
target number and scale the amount of information you give
them up or down based on the player’s relative roll result.

   DIFFICULTY ROLLS
When a PC rolls against an adversary, the stat block provides
a Difficulty for the roll. However, if an NPC doesn’t have a
stat block—or if you like the unpredictability of rolling—
you can have that NPC make a roll to determine what the
Difficulty would be. Though this can add to the time it takes
to resolve the scene, it can also be a useful tool in situations
where you’re unsure what the Difficulty should be. To make a
Difficulty Roll, roll a d20 and add any relevant Experience the
NPC or adversary has to its total.
  Tip: Attack rolls against adversaries use that stat block’s
  assigned Difficulty. For other PC action rolls, it’s often easiest
  to add the relevant Experience to the adversary’s current
  Difficulty to determine the new Difficulty.

ADVERSARY ROLLS
Adversaries aren’t limited to just the attacks and unique actions in their stat blocks; those represent their special abilities,
but they can do most anything a PC would do, such as picking a lock or climbing a cliff. However, other than the attack rolls
described in the next section, adversaries don’t typically make action rolls.
When you want an adversary’s action to have a chance of failure, you can offer the PCs the opportunity to make a reaction roll
or otherwise respond to the situation. This highlights the agency of the PCs and keeps the story focused on them. For example,
when a Kraken attacks the party’s boat to throw them into the sea, you might have the PCs all make a Strength or Agility
Reaction Roll to see if they’re able to keep themselves from falling overboard. For dramatic or difficult tasks that the PCs can’t
influence, you might want to roll to see if the adversary succeeds. To do so, spend a Fear to utilize any relevant Experience the
adversary might have, then roll a d20. These rolls are more interesting if you tell the players the Difficulty and roll where they
can see the result.

   ADVERSARY ATTACK ROLLS
When an adversary you’re controlling attacks a PC, you’ll make a simplified version of the attack roll made by players. Every
adversary can make normal attacks using the weapon in their stat block, and some adversaries can also use special moves
to attack.

RUNNING GM NPCS
When you run NPCs as the GM, you should always strive to follow your GM principles and use them to bring the world to life.
Differentiate each character by the unique ways they speak and act—you can use a new voice, posture, or set of mannerisms if
you’re comfortable—and lean into their individual motives to fill the world with dynamic, active NPCs.

 • A fall from Close range deals 1d20+5 physical damage.
 • A fall from Far or Very Far range deals 1d100+15 physical
   damage, or death at the GM’s discretion.
If a character collides with an object or another character at a
dangerous speed, they take 1d20+5 direct physical damage.
You can always increase or decrease the damage dice to fit
the story.

Adversary Motives
Ben decides that the corrupted Earth Elemental wants to
sever all connections between mortals and nature so that
nature can return to a primordial state of unchecked growth.
The elemental corrupted the dryads and other forest spirits
have been warped by capitalizing on their resentment of
outsiders and stoking their fears about the forest being
destroyed. Now the elemental can possess them at will
without their knowledge or memory.
The fight will take place in a former druid grove using
the Abandoned Grove environment, the site of a bloody
confrontation where the possessed dryads and other nature
spirits killed most of the druids and drove out the others.
Complicating the situation is the fact that the dryads don’t
remember being possessed, only a violent conflict with
the druids over a poorly remembered disagreement. Any
substantial conversation with the dryads in the grove exposes
that foggy memory and provides a thread to pull on. Ben plans
to have the elemental assume direct control and attack the
party after just a couple of beats of interaction, using a
hidden countdown.
When the fight starts, Ben plans to hint at the manipulation by
describing the dryads and treants moving as if they were being
controlled, with the Dryads weeping as they pull down trees
to attack the party. This complicates the apparent motives of
the adversaries and should prime the PCs to look beyond first
appearances to find out what’s going on.

Empower your players to frame their own downtime scenes. Ask the players what it looks like as they tend to their wounds or
unwind together, encouraging them to take the reins and work with other players whose characters are involved.

project is skill dependent, you can ask how the PC makes
progress and then call for a roll using a trait that matches
their approach.
When a player rolls to progress their project, it doesn’t feel
great if the roll simply ends in failure. If you use the Dynamic
Countdown Advancement table in the earlier “Countdowns”
section, consider letting a failure give the PC special insight
into their goal, which grants them advantage on their next
roll for that project. Alternatively, you can instead use the
following criteria so the PC always makes progress even
on a failure:
 • Critical Success: 4 ticks
 • Success with Hope: 3 ticks
 • Success with Fear: 2 ticks
 • Any failure: 1 tick

   GM DOWNTIME
When players use downtime to rest and refresh, you gain Fear
and can progress a countdown happening in the background:
 • On a short rest, gain 1d4 Fear.
 • On a long rest, gain an amount of Fear equal to the
   number of PCs + 1d4 and advance a long-term countdown.
This helps make the world feel alive—and it reminds players
that the more resting they do, the more the world moves
without them, so they might want to be careful
how much they rest.

CHARACTER DEATH
Adjudicating and overseeing the death of a PC may be among the most difficult tasks for a GM. In a game focused on character
relationships, personal story arcs, and heroic adventure, the death of a PC should not happen casually. As the GM, you’re
charged with honestly portraying the world, and death is more permanent in Daggerheart than in other games of the same
genre. Use the following principles to help you navigate these moments fairly and empathetically.
  Tip: Adversaries follow different rules for death than PCs; see “Defeated Adversaries” on page 208 for details.

with the player to determine how that manifests. The situation
might escalate as a new wave of enemies approaches or a

  186     Chapter 3: Running a Campaign
INCORPORATING PLAYER
BACKSTORIES
One of the most important tools in a GM’s arsenal is to ask
your players questions and incorporate their answers—their
responses will tell you what they find exciting. The most
important details to utilize while building a campaign are the
answers to a character’s Background Questions.
The Background Questions are designed to generate story
hooks the players care about, which you can leverage for
narrative fodder during the campaign. Take good notes during
character creation and ask follow-up questions. Don’t be
afraid to dig deeper into anything the players offer up during
this process. If they make up a person, ask them for their
name. If they invent a place, ask them what it’s called and
what it’s like. Ensure you record at least one or two things
about the world that are important to each player and their
character. The more you incorporate these things into the
campaign, the more invested that player tends to become.

   BACKSTORY NOTES
After character creation, create a simple list of important narrative elements the players have given you, sorted by character.
For example, you might make the following notes about the PCs:
Marigold Seok (She/Her)—Seaborne Elf Ranger                        Jasper Flores (They/Them)—Highborne Halfling Bard

   A LARGER PLOT
When you run a campaign, you might prefer to have PCs explore a number of smaller arcs using the structure above. You can
also nest this structure within one overarching plot. In heroic adventures, this often manifests as a quest to stop the villain,
protect the kingdom, or save the world—a challenge the PCs must overcome that affects the wider world and the people in it. If
you want to include a larger plot, it will appear more or less in each session, remaining throughout your story until the characters
finally arrive at the climax of the campaign.

   Difficulty
Adversaries don’t use Evasion like PCs—instead, all rolls
against them use their Difficulty. The bandit has a Difficulty of
12, so a roll of 12 or higher succeeds against this adversary.
If an adversary’s feature doesn’t specify a Difficulty (like an
Agility Reaction Roll), it always uses the adversary’s Difficulty.

   Adversary Actions
Adversary actions can be divided into three categories:
 • Standard Attacks
   Each adversary has a standard attack. This includes their
   attack modifier, the name of the attack, its range, and its
   damage. When you spotlight an adversary, you can always
   use their standard attack as long as they are within range
   or can move within range.
 • Unique Actions
   Many adversaries have special actions listed on the
   bottom of their stat block. These represent their innate
   abilities, magical talents, and other combat techniques.
   Unique actions might allow the adversary to make an
   attack, force PCs to make a reaction roll, or even change
   the landscape. When you spotlight an adversary, you              Adversary Passives

Choosing
Adversaries
It’s time to build a combat encounter!
The upcoming “Battle Guide” section gives a starting point
for building balanced encounters. The following pages break
down each type of adversary and provide guidance for
building your own.

BATTLE GUIDE
This guide will help you roughly balance an encounter so you
can determine how many and which adversaries to use. You’ll
first calculate your starting Battle Points, which determine
your budget for the encounter. Then you’ll adjust the budget
up and down based on other factors. Finally, you’ll build the
encounter, spending Battle Points to add adversaries until you
have no more to spend.
When planning a battle, start with the following formula to
calculate how many Battle Points you should spend:
                                                                       Spending Battle Points

   Custom Standards
Most everything about a Standard adversary is going to be in
the average range for the tier. You can use the tables in the
upcoming “Improvising Adversaries” section to choose the
average for their attack modifier and the moderate damage
dice for their tier. This makes them simple to create. Where
Standards shine is in the features that define their role in the
fiction, such as the Bladed Guard’s “Shield Wall,” the Spectral
Guardian’s “Ghost,” or the Vampire’s “Draining Bite.”

IMPROVISING ADVERSARIES
Sometimes you want to use an adversary but they’re too powerful (or not powerful enough) for your party’s tier. Or you might
want to replace a feature or two, then present them as an entirely different creature. When planning your session (or even mid-
session), you can adjust an existing adversary’s stat block to fit the needs of your battle.
When you’re mid-session and you realize you need a new adversary, don’t sweat. You can quickly adjust a stat block to a
different tier by replacing its existing statistics with those listed on the Improvised Statistics by Tier table, using the column that
corresponds to your party’s tier.

ENVIRONMENT FEATURES                                               reserving them for when they’re most impactful.
The bottom of each stat block lists that environment’s features.

   Feature Questions
Below each feature, you’ll find italicized questions. These
questions are there to inspire plot hooks, provide ideas to fuel
the scene, and help connect the scene to other story elements.
For example, the Raging River’s “Undertow” feature asks,
“What trinkets and baubles lie along the bottom of the riverbed?
Do predators swim these rivers?” These questions invite you
to consider who or what has been here before, what their
presence has left behind, as well as what predators might take
advantage of the powerful undertow for their own benefit.

ADAPTING ENVIRONMENTS
Sometimes you want to use an environment but it’s at the wrong tier for your party. Or you might want to replace a feature or
two, then present it as an entirely different environment. Whether planning your session or even improvising an environment
mid-session, you can adjust an existing environment’s stat block to fit the needs of your scene or improvise elements as needed.
The environments framework is there to help organize ideas, not to stifle creativity.
When you need to quickly adjust a stat block to a different tier, you can simply replace its existing statistics with those listed on
the Environment Statistics by Tier table, using the column that corresponds to your party’s tier.

FEATURES
Chaos Magic Locus - Passive: When a PC makes a Spellcast Roll,
 they must roll two Fear Dice and take the higher result.
 What does it feel like to work magic in this chaos-touched place?
 What do you fear will happen if you lose control of the spell?
The Indigo Flame - Passive: PCs who approach the central tree
 can make a Knowledge Roll to try to identify the magic that
 consumed this environment.
  • On a success: They learn three of the below details. On a
    success with Fear, they learn two.
  • On a failure: They can mark a Stress to learn one and
    gain advantage on the next action roll to investigate
    this environment.
  • Details: This is a result of Fallen magic. The corruption is
    spread through the ashen moss. It can be cleansed only by a
    ritual of nature magic with a Progress Countdown (8).
 What Fallen cult corrupted these woods? What have they already
 done with the cursed wood and sap from this tree?
Grasping Vines - Action: Animate vines bristling with thorns whip
 out from the underbrush to ensnare the PCs. A target must
 succeed on an Agility Reaction Roll or become Restrained and
 Vulnerable until they break free, clearing both conditions, with a
 successful Finesse or Strength Roll or by dealing 10 damage to
 the vines. When the target makes a roll to escape, they take
 1d8+4 physical damage and lose a Hope.
 What painful memories do the vines bring to the surface as they
 pierce ﬂesh?
Charcoal Constructs - Action: Warped animals wreathed in indigo
 flame trample through a point of your choice. All targets within
 Close range of that point must make an Agility Reaction Roll.
 Targets who fail take 3d12+3 physical damage. Targets who
 succeed take half damage instead.
 Are these real animals consumed by the ﬂame or merely constructs of
 the corrupting magic?
Choking Ash - Reaction: Countdown (Loop ). When the PCs enter
 the Burning Heart of the Woods, activate the countdown. When
 it triggers, all characters must make a Strength or Instinct
 Reaction Roll. Targets who fail take 4d6+5 direct physical
 damage. Targes who succeed take half damage. Protective
 masks or clothes give advantage on the reaction roll.
 What hallucinations does the ash induce? What incongruous taste
 does it possess?

In exchange for protection from the Witherwild for themselves
and their families, some Wicklings from these groups have
been forced to take jobs as farmers in Haven’s flower fields.

DISTINCTIONS

   The Weeks of Day and Night
The day and night cycle occurs weekly, meaning the sun rises
for an entire week before setting into a nighttime of the same
length. This has an impact on everything from agriculture to
trade, as many merchants refuse to travel through the night.
But this cycle doesn’t just affect Wicklings, it’s dictated how
Fanewick’s wondrous ecology has evolved. Days and nights
are accompanied by entirely different natural soundscapes
as Fanewick’s nocturnal denizens sleep through the long days
and stalk the woods in times of darkness while their diurnal
counterparts sleep. The plants similarly live on this strange
day-night loop, and many live out their entire life cycles in a
week. Sun rose vines make a thorny ascent to the top of the
tree canopy over the course of the week, only to wilt under the
light of the moon. Conversely, night bloom, a bioluminescent
flower that emits the smell of burnt sugar and decay,
only blossoms when evening falls, illuminating patches of
forest—a godsend to anyone forced to travel in the dark.

   The Serpent’s Sickness
The plague sweeping across Haven spares no one. Since
the initial outbreak, Haven officials have worked tirelessly to
quarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but this
effort has done little to stop its spread. Due to the rarity of
crimson lady’s veil, many citizens began to carry or consume
all manner of flowers and snake sheddings in an attempt to
protect or cure themselves.
In the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough
laden with dust that resembles powdered bone. Then a scaled
rash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique
and painful pattern that resembles a snake’s skin. Not long
after, the victims’ bodies harden until their organs solidify and
cease to function. The final stages of the Serpent’s Sickness is
so quick that many transform into statues where they stand,
leaving all of Haven a cenotaph to a once-great power.

   Lady’s Veil
These small flowers grow in patches of sun throughout
Fanewick. For every ten thousand blossoms of white-petaled
flowers, one blooms a unique and vibrant red. These flowers
have long been used in herbal teas across the region, with the
crimson flowers holding a place in specific ceremonies. Even
so, they were only foraged until the Havenites discovered
crimson lady’s veil—the only known cure for Serpent’s
Sickness.
Thus, the Haven Army invaded Fanewick and began cultivating
the flowers on massive farms that have overtaken the region’s
bogs. Though the theft of the Reaping Eye has created an
indefinite growing season, the red flowers remain just as rare,
and Fanewick is permeated by a sickly sweet smell as the
Haven Army races to mass-produce a cure for the Serpent’s
Sickness.

DISTINCTIONS
Use this information to prepare your campaign. You can also
share it with your players as needed.

   A World on the Edge
Five Banners Burning features a setting on the verge of open
warfare. When that war will break out depends on you, but
it is almost inevitable. The conflict between nations will be
fought in ballrooms and back alleys as much as in castles and
valleys, and people from all backgrounds will be caught in the
growing conflict despite their best efforts.

   Tipping the Scales of History
The party will be in a unique position to have a significant
impact on the conflict between these nations. Ensure they’re
connected to the major players, factions, leaders, or other
catalysts so they’re always in the thick of the conflict.

   Big Questions
To best engage with the thematic elements of this campaign,
keep these questions in mind throughout each session:
 • Does power always corrupt?
 • In what ways is the road to disaster paved with good
   intentions?
 • What does just governance look like?
 • How do you decide who to protect and uplift with limited
   resources?
 • How do you manage divided loyalties without betraying
   someone, including yourself?

   Collateral Damage
As conflict escalates, it will displace monsters from their
ecosystems, upset the natural and magical balance of Althas,
and drive people from their homes to become refugees within
or beyond their nation’s borders.

CAMPAIGN MECHANICS
The following mechanics are unique to this campaign.

   Faction Relationships
Use a campaign sheet to track the relationships between the nations, as well as their major assets and problems. Each
nation has a relationship rating with the other nations, ranging from Nemeses (−3) to Close Allies (+3). The more intense the
relationship, the more the nation will act for or against the other nation, even at risk to themselves. Nations that are Friendly
(+1) will render help if it does not require much effort or risk, but nations that are Nemeses (−3) will go out on a limb just to see
the other suffer.

MAKING A BEAST FEAST
   A Big Book of Recipes!
The party will create a cookbook together as they play through this campaign frame. The players should choose a small
notebook they can share, then decorate it as they’d like (stickers, colored markers, and paint are highly encouraged). This
notebook is their cookbook—during downtime, they’ll record each recipe they make, including its name, the ingredients, the
cooking method, and how it turned out. The cookbook is shared by the players, who should all get the chance to contribute to it.
The more the characters practice making meals with the same flavor profile, the easier that combination becomes to prepare!

creativity, you can oftentimes parlay with or even redeem
what hunts you before resorting to complete destruction.
Many lost to the dark still retain some aspects of themselves
to appeal to, and rumored magics could hold the key to
cleansing elements of the Umbra’s corruption.

   Embrace Lethality
The Age of Umbra is a realm of hardship, challenge, and loss,
which allows for momentous revelations and incomparable
victories. Still, very few groups of heroes who venture out into
the Halcyon Domain carry any of the same faces when their
journey is done. Find joy in the risks, relish the opportunities
for epic and memorable character deaths, and excitedly
create new characters that the others can meet at the next
encampment or landmark.

  MOTHERBOARD
The tallest spire at the center of the Echo Vale is the
Motherboard, from which all threads of the Network
originate. Though no one has ever been able to enter this
daunting tower, each city has their own beliefs about its
ancient power. Most citizens revere the massive presence
within as a god, believing it was worshipped by the fallen
civilization and carries their wisdom forward to bless today’s
information-scarce world. Others believe it is a “master
program” the technomancers of the fallen world left behind,
and is therefore as fallible as any other remnant. Though
the Motherboard herself does not communicate with
people directly, she shepherds all data and power through
the Network. Without her operating system, the valley’s
technology would eventually fail. Despite what is commonly
believed, some technomancers and pilgrims claim to speak to
the Motherboard in the machine language, known as “kohd.”
Technomancers are the datacrafters who utilize ancient
machines for new purposes. Historians work to decipher
kohd, while practitioners work directly with remnants and
other technology to gain a deeper understanding of this
arcane language. Some forgo study of kohd entirely in favor of
simply utilizing machines for their power. Most have a general
understanding of how to employ the effects of the fallen
world’s technology, allowing them to operate and control its
powerful programs, even without understanding its inner
workings. Because this tech isn’t fully understood by the
people of the modern age, technomancers can manage only
temporary repairs on the remnants.
Machinists are more focused on the physical aspects of
remnants. Many of them work in factories or scrap works,
repairing gears, wires, and processors for a variety of
machines, including remnants and mechanicals (operator-
driven machines). Some machinists can cobble together new
remnants from spare parts, but they must use old remnant
cores from the fallen world to give them life. Stories tell of

GM PRINCIPLES
Keep the following guidance in mind while you GM this campaign.

   Fill the World with the Ruins of Technology
Because the innovation of the fallen ones was so advanced,
the people who live in the Echo Vale today have molded their
lives around the technology that remains. Even so, they don’t
understand it well enough to rebuild the systems that gave
the fallen world its immense power. Fill the world with the
ruins of state-of-the-art buildings and machines, weather them
with centuries of nature’s intrusion, and then describe the
less-advanced world built among them. You may also want to
decide what led to the downfall of the past civilization, then
use that to flavor the world they left behind.
 • What does the wreckage of a strip mall look like with a
   small encampment of wooden homes built within?
 • What particular pieces of technology have people been
   able to keep running? How have they adapted them?
Additionally, you’re encouraged to reflavor Daggerheart
adversaries as remnants.
 • How would an adversary’s abilities manifest if they were
   made of circuits and steel? How does their appearance
   change? Do they have different motivations?

   Make the Details Fantastical and the Conflicts
   Grounded
Though the Echo Vale is filled with fantastical technology
that causes large-scale problems, each confrontation should
center the struggles of its people, be they cultural, political,
or spiritual. Use technology as window dressing for grounded
conflict to blend the exciting details of the campaign with
personal stakes for each character. You can use the abilities
of remnants and the aspects of cities as allegories for
the emotional experiences of the party. For example, if a
member of the party recently lost a family member, you could
introduce them to an NPC in the Wastes who’s protecting a
remnant they were raised alongside, despite the fact that its
recent corruption has caused it to become violent.
 • How does the use of technology highlight a conflict
   between individuals or groups?
 • What remnants can act as physical representations of
   emotional turmoil?

   Pit Tradition Against Progress
There are numerous conflicting ideologies among the cities
and travelers of the Echo Vale, but most can be distilled into
two schools of thought: Some people want to reject their
predecessor’s technology, allowing the people of today the
chance to define themselves and make their own way in this
new world. Others believe they must dig further into the past
to harness the powerful machines the fallen world left behind.
 • How do these opposing viewpoints come into conflict?
 • How do the political and social conflicts affect characters
   personally?

Priv Rhodek gives her word that any scrap the party acquires
while protecting the city is theirs to keep. In return, she asks
that they collect as many remnant cores as possible so she
can pass them to her technomancers to diagnose the cause of
the violence. She also gives the party the name of a surprising
contact to see before they head into the scrap factory where
many attacks have occurred.
The contact is Mac the Scrap Jack (wanderborne faun,
he/him), who runs an illegal scrap operation, making him an
unlikely friend for the very person that outlaws his work. But
on the Priv’s word, he gives the party a Hotspot. This illegal
device can be carried as a backpack and, when set down and
activated, it stalls out nearby remnants for a few moments,
allowing the party to get out of a bind.
He also gives the party an offer: save one of the remnant cores
they recover and bring it to him instead of Rhodek. He’ll pay
them a few quantum, and they’ll have the opportunity to look
at the data from the core to try and see what’s “causing all this
ruckus with the rems.”
As they fight their way through the factory, does the party
have compassion for the once-tame remnants, or do they
dispose of them indiscriminately? Will the players try to talk
to the factory workers to learn more about the Remnant’s
Fury, or will they operate like a cleanup crew, keep their eye
on the scrap they stand to gain? Will they bring the Priv all the
remnant cores they collect, or will they save one for Mac and
risk trouble from the city guard? If they perform well, will Priv
Rhodek tell the party more about the Remnant’s Fury and the
involvement of the Motherboard?

   Crafting & Trading
In this campaign frame, gold is not used as a currency.
Instead, PCs can gather scrap to trade for a currency known
as quantum. The Motherboard character sheet module helps
to track their current scrap, along with how much quantum
they have to spend. All PCs start with 5 quantum.

The Quantum Economy
Use the following conversion for Daggerheart when pricing
other goods and services using quantum.
10 quantum = 1 handful of gold
100 quantum = 1 bag of gold
1000 quantum = 1 chest of gold

Gathering Scrap
When the PCs defeat remnant adversaries, they can collect
scrap after the combat. There are three categories of scrap,
each with an associated die size: Shards (d6), Metals (d8),
and Components (d10). When the PCs are collecting scrap,
determine which categories of scrap and how many of each
(which determines the number of dice they roll) they can find.
Each player individually rolls the dice you determine, and
the result of each die is compared to the associated scrap         Example: After a standard fight with some remnants, the

RELICS
There is an additional category of scrap called Relics. These are unique pieces of scrap only found on specific remnant
adversaries. When PCs defeat a particularly important or powerful remnant adversary, you might grant them each a Relic along
with scrap from the table above. These relics should be customized based on the adversary, such as steelhorn of the stag, lens
of the flickering falcon, jaw piston of the cryodrake, or gold scales of the scrappersnap. Relics are worth 20 quantum and are
often used to craft powerful augments.
You should also provide opportunities for PCs to seek specific Shard, Metal, or Component rewards, whether that be through
NPC contracts, hunting down particular adversaries, exploring certain areas, or through scrap shacks.
  Tip: The values on the Scrap Reward Table above are designed for a campaign of around 50 sessions, with 1-2 fights per session.
  If you plan to do a shorter or longer campaign, adjust your rewards accordingly.

WRITING IN KOHD
Language designed by Chris Willett
Kohd, the language of the fallen world’s technology, has long been a mystery to the people of the Echo Vale. If you’d like to
give your players the opportunity to learn how to decipher and write in it over the course of a campaign, you’re encouraged
to use this language. We recommend delivering them messages early on from the Motherboard that they can’t read, having
technomancers reveal pieces of the language to them as they progress through the story, and then finally giving them the tools
to read and write the full language by the climax.

Continuing, we can get all the way to MOTHERB. At that
point, if we were to connect the trace to the MNO node,
the order of letters would become vague. To keep this from
happening, draw a ring around or within the MNO node and
connect the trace line to that ring.

Continue on, adding trace lines, subnodes, and node rings as
needed until you reach the last letter of the word.

Colossus Maps
If you’d like to use maps and minis to help you and the players maintain spacial awareness of a colossus fight, but you’re
struggling with how to represent the fight without a massive figurine, you can build out the basic shape of your colossus using
notecards, such as the following example visuals. When a PC climbs onto a segment of the colossus, place their miniature
directly on the notecard. This setup can help you and the players remember where each PC is and which segments are adjacent
to them. It can also help you visualize how you can use each segment’s features and shake up the battle.

  BEASTFORM
  Mark a Stress to magically transform into a creature of your tier or
  lower from the Beastform list. You can drop out of this form at any
  time. While transformed, you can’t use weapons or cast spells from
  domain cards, but you can still use other features or abilities you                           inventory weapon                                                  PRIMARY      SECONDARY

  Evasion bonus to your Evasion, and use the trait specified in their
  statistics for your attack. While you’re in a Beastform, your armor                              FEATURE
  becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as usual; when
  you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor Slots remain

danger - Ask questions and incorporate the answers - Make every roll important - Play to ﬁ  nd out what happens - Hold on gently
GM Best Practices: Cultivate a curious table - Gain your players’ trust - Keep the story moving forward - Cut to the action - Help the 
players use the game - Create a meta conversation - Tell them what they would know - Ground the world in motive - Bring the game’s mechanics to life - Reframe rather than reject - Work in moments and montages 
Example GM MOves
• Show how the world reacts. 
“The kick shatters the door. Light 
spills in from the barracks as a half-dozen sleepy soldiers stumble to their feet, looking worried.”
• Ask a question and build on the answer.
“How is it that you notice the 
assassin lurking in the treetops?”
• Make an NPC act in accordance 
with their motive.
“The Jagged Knife Bandit snips 
the gold purse off the merchant’s hip and attempts to escape.”
• Lean on the character’s goalsto drive them to action.
“The relic you’ve been trying to 
recover for your people ﬂ  oats ominously in the center of the altar, surrounded by cultists preparing to drain its power.”
• Signal an imminent off-screen threat.
“You hear the crashing of 
falling trees and shattered branches as thundering stepsapproach. What do you do?”
• Reveal an unwelcome truth or unexpected danger.
“He reaches into his cloak and 
produces the Orb of Vengeanceas you realize that he was the necromancer the entire time.”
• Force the group to split up.
“The elementals are scattering—two
heading for the town, three bearing down on the mill. What do you do?”
• Make a PC mark Stress as a 
consequence for their actions.
“You can pull the baron to safety 
if you mark a Stress. Otherwise you can only get yourself out of the way. What do you do?”• Make a move the 
characters don’t see.
“You brace for the alarm... 
but the door clicks open and everything seems ﬁ  ne... for now.”
• Show the collateral damage.
“The Minotaur Wrecker barrels into 
the street, shattering a vegetable cart, sending cabbages ﬂ  ying and knocking the merchant into the wall.”
• Clear a temporary condition or effect.

that are holding her legs in place. She looks around to ﬁ  nd her next target and raises her sword.”
• Shift the environment.
“As soon as you cross, the 
ancient rope bridge snaps,leaving you stranded.”
• Spotlight an adversary.
“As the Skeleton Dredge shambles
forward to strike you, you see the two others on their ﬂ  ank turn their attention toward you as well.”
• Capture someone or something important.
“The thief slides past you and
jumps into the cart, grabbing the idol from the seat and stufﬁ  ng it into their pouch.”

Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025CHOOSE A CLASS
Your class represents the kind of 
character you’ll be playing and gives 
you access to certain abilities and spells 
during the game. Take the character 
sheet speciﬁ  c to this class.
Each class has a number of subclasses to 
choose from that help deﬁ  ne what kind of 
focus you’d like your character to have. 
Take the foundation card for your chosen 
subclass.
CHOOSE A HERITAGE
Your character’s heritage is made up of 
both an ancestry and a community card. 
These two cards establish your character’s 
physical appearance and the environment 
they grew up in. 
ASSIGN CHARACTER TRAITS
Distribute the values −1, 0, 0, +1, +1, +2  
across your character traits. When rolling, 
you’ll add the value of that character trait 
to the roll. 
RECORD CHARACTER INFORMATION
Next, record your starting Evasion. 
Additionally, gain 2 Hope to start the 
game.CHOOSE STARTING EQUIPMENT
Decide which weapons you want to start 
the game with and record their details 
in the appropriate spaces in the “Active 
Weapons” section. CHOOSE SMOR
Next, take one of the available options for 
starting armor and record its details in the 
appropriate spaces. Your armor comes 
with its own damage thresholds and base 
armor score. Record this alongside your 
selection under “Active Armor.” Add your 
thresholds to your level and record those 
numbers under the “Damage & Health” 
section. Also record the Base Armor Score, 
plus modiﬁ  ers from any features, in the 
large shield labeled “Armor” at the top of 
the sheet.
The starting inventory for your class 
is listed on your character guide. 
Record those items in the “Inventory” 
section of your character sheet.
CREATE YOUR BACKGROUND
Make description choices from the 
available options on your character guide 
(or create your own). This will help you 
start to build out your character’s look and 
attitude. 
Then use the background questions on 
your character guide as a jumping-off   point 
to build out your character’s history (or 
create your own questions).
Finally, name your character and choose 
which pronouns they use. CREATE YOUR EXPERIENCES
Use all the choices and backstory 
you’ve made about your character 
so far to generate their starting two 
Experiences, a set of narrative words 
or phrases that represent what they’ve 
learned or become on their journey so far. 
Assign both a modiﬁ  er of +2.
CHOOSE DOMAIN DECK CARDS
Each class is made up of two diff  erent 
domains, which are listed below the class 
name on the character sheet. Choose two 
cards total from the level 1 cards in those 
domains. You can share these decks with 
other players. If you do, make sure to 
talk with them about which cards they’re 
interested in. ANSWERND QUESTIONS
CREATE CONNECTIONS
Ask any of the Connection questions 
on your character guide to the other 
players at the table (or generate your own 
questions). Use this as an opportunity to 
also discuss how your characters all met, 
what brought them together, and why 
they’ve decided to travel as a party.1

Downtime represents moments of respite within the perilous journey the characters are on together. It’s 
not only an opportunity to recover and prepare for what lies ahead, but also a time to share more quiet, 
intimate scenes that help to build or showcase the relationships characters have with one another.Level 1  Tier 1 Levels 2 –4  Tier 2 Levels 5 –7  Tier 3 Levels 8 –10  Tier 4ACTION ROLL RESULTS
• On a critical success , you get what you want and 
a little extra. You gain a Hope and clear a Stress.
• On a success with Hope , you pull it off   well and 
get what you want. You gain a Hope.
• On a success with Fear , you get what you want, 
but it comes with a cost or consequence. You 
might get attacked , get limited information, attract 
danger, or face another complication. The GM gains 
a Fear.
• On a failure with Hope , things don’t go to plan. 
You probably don’t get what you want and there are 
consequences, but you gain a Hope.
• On a failure with Fear , things go very badly. You 
probably don’t get what you want, and a major 
consequence or complication occurs because of it.  
The GM gains a Fear.
DAMAGE ROLLS
After a successful attack, roll a number of your 
weapon’s damage dice equal to your Proﬁ  ciency and 
add them together.
If your attack roll critically succeeds, your attack 
deals extra damage! Start with the highest possible 
value the damage dice can roll, and then make a 
damage roll as usual, adding it to that value.
Reaction rolls
Reaction rolls work similarly to action rolls, except 
they don’t generate Hope, Fear, or additional GM 
moves.
USING ARMOR
Your Armor Score represents how many Armor Slots 
you have available. When you take damage, you 
can mark an Armor Slot to reduce the severity by 
one threshold. You can only mark 1 Armor Slot per 
incoming attack.QUICK REFERENCE
Advantage:  Add a d6 advantage die to your roll.
Disadvantage: Subtract a  d6 disadvantage die from 
your roll.
Help an Ally: Spend a Hope and roll a d6 advantage 
die to add to an ally’s roll. If the ally has gained 
advantage on a roll from multiple sources, they only 
add the highest result to their roll.
Group Action: Nominate a leader of the action. All 
other participants in the group action roll make a 
reaction roll using whichever traits they and the 
GM decide best ﬁ  t (they don’t need to use the same 
traits). The leader then makes an action roll. Their 
action roll gains a +1 bonus for each reaction roll that 
succeeds and a −1 penalty for each reaction roll that 
fails. 
Tag Team Roll: Once per session, each player can 
choose to spend 3 Hope  and initiate a Tag Team 
Roll between their character and another PC. When 
you do, work with the other character’s player to 
describe how you combine your actions in a unique 
and exciting way. You both make separate action 
rolls, but before resolving the roll’s outcome, choose 
one of the rolls to apply for both of your results. On a 
roll with Hope, all PCs involved gain a Hope. On a roll 
with Fear, the GM gains a Fear for each PC involved. 
If you succeed on a Tag Team Roll attack, you both 
roll damage, then add it together to determine the 
damage dealt.
Vulnerable: When a creature has the Vulnerable  
condition, all rolls against them have advantage.
Restrained: When a creature has the Restrained  
condition, they can’t move, but they can still take 
actions from their current position.
Hidden: While you’re out of sight from all foes and 
they don’t know where you are, you gain the Hidden  
condition. While you’re Hidden , any rolls against you 
have disadvantage. 
Direct Damage: Armor Slots can’t be marked to 
reduce this damage.Critical Success! 
If the Hope and Fear Die both
land on the same number, 
it’s a critical success.
SHORT REST
Each player can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards 
in their vault, then choose two of the following moves (or choose 
the same move twice). The GM gains 1d4 Fear.
• Tend to Wounds
Describe how you hastily patch yourself up, then clear a number 
of Hit Points equal to 1d4 + your tier. You can do this to an ally 
instead.
• Clear Stress
Describe how you blow off   steam or pull yourself together, then 
clear a number of Stress equal to 1d4 + your tier.
• Repair Armor
Describe how you quickly repair your armor, then clear a number 
of Armor Slots equal to 1d4 + your tier. You can do this to an 
ally’s armor instead.
• Prepare
Describe how you prepare yourself for the path ahead, then gain 
a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more members of 
your party, you each gain 2 Hope.LONG REST
Each player can swap any domain cards in their loadout for cards in their vault, then choose 
two of the following moves (or choose the same move twice). The GM gains an amount of 
Fear equal to the number of PCs + 1d4 and can advance a long-term countdown.
• Tend to All Wounds
Describe how you patch yourself up, then clear all Hit Points. 
You can do this to an ally instead.
• Clear All Stress
Describe how you blow off   steam or pull yourself together, then clear all Stress.
• Repair All Armor
Describe how you spend time repairing your armor, then clear all Armor Slots. 
You can do this to an ally’s armor instead.
• Prepare
Describe how you prepare for the next day’s adventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to 
Prepare with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.
• Work on a Project
Establish or continue work on a project. The GM might ask for a 
roll to determine how much to tick down the progress countdown.PLA Y GUIDE

File: Daggerheart-Pad-GameSheets.indd | Output Date: 12/18/24 - 11:21Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025This section denotes your class. Each class is made up of 
two domains. You choose your abilities and spells from 
these domains.This section gives you a place to record your name, 
pronouns, heritage (the combination of your community 
and ancestry), and subclass. There is also a space to 
record your level . 
This is where you record your Hope. You spend Hope to 
use an Experience (details below), Help an Ally, use a 
Hope Feature, or initiate a Tag Team Roll. When you 
Help an Ally, you explain how you’re aiding them and roll 
a d6 advantage die they add to their action roll total. 
You start with 2 Hope marked.
Your class’s unique Hope Feature is in this section as well.
This is where you keep track of your gold during a 
campaign. If you would mark your tenth handful, you 
instead mark a bag and erase all your handfuls. If you 
would mark your tenth bag, you instead mark a chest 
and erase your bags. You start with one handful of 
gold.Your  inventory is where you store items and consumables.  
Each class starts with a unique class feature that sets 
them apart from other classes. Make sure to read through 
them before you begin playing.
This is where you store weapons you want to carry but 
not have active. While a weapon is in your inventory, you 
can’t beneﬁ  t from its feature.
SLIDE THIS SIDE OUT TO THE RIGHT 
OF YOUR CHARACTER SHEET.SLIDE THIS SIDE OUT TO THE LEFT 
OF YOUR CHARACTER SHEET.Experience represents your character’s particular 
specializations your character has. These are narrative 
tags that you create to reﬂ  ect what your character is 
skilled in. When they apply to the scene, you can spend a 
Hope before the action roll to add an Experience’s value 
as a modiﬁ  er. You earn more Experiences throughout a 
campaign.This is the section for your armor. Along with a name, 
armor has base thresholds that contribute to your 
damage thresholds, and a base score that contributes 
to your Armor Score. The armor’s feature describes its 
special abilities or the requirements to use it.Evasion represents your ability to avoid an attack. The 
GM rolls against this number when determining if an 
adversary hits you. If you do get hit, you can choose to 
mark an Armor Slot (the small empty shields to the right 
of the large “Armor” shield) to reduce the severity of the 
incoming damage by one threshold. You have a number 
of available slots equal to your Armor Score (the number 
in the large “Armor” shield).This area contains your six character traits. You use 
these as your primary modiﬁ  ers on action rolls. The 
descriptions beneath each trait remind you how to use 
them.
The two smaller boxes are your damage thresholds. 
These come from your armor, and you always add your 
level to their value. When you take damage, compare it to 
the numbers here. If the incoming damage is Minor, you 
mark a Hit Point. If it is Major, you mark 2 Hit Points. If 
it is Severe , you mark 3 Hit Points. If you ever need to 
mark Stress and can’t, mark a Hit Point. If you ever mark 
your last Hit Point, you must make a death move.This is the section for your active weapons. Along with 
a name, weapons have an associated trait that you roll 
when using them for an attack. They also have a range 
(Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, or Very Far). The GM tells 
you what range a target is at relative to your character. 
Damage dice are the kind of dice you roll when you 
make a successful attack, and the damage type is either 
physical or magic. Proﬁ  ciency tells you how many 
damage dice you roll. A weapon’s feature describes its 
special abilities or the requirements to use it. 
Weapons are either one-handed or two-handed. Fill in 
the appropriate number of hands based on the weapons 
you take.character sheet sidecar

BEASTFORM
Mark a Stress  to magically transform into a creature of your tier or 
lower from the Beastform list. You can drop out of this form at any 
time. While transformed, you can’t use weapons or cast spells from 
domain cards, but you can still use other features or abilities you 
have access to. Spells you cast before you transform stay active and 
last for their normal duration, and you can talk and communicate as 
normal. Additionally, you gain the Beastform’s features, add their 
Evasion bonus to your Evasion, and use the trait specified in their 
statistics for your attack. While you’re in a Beastform, your armor 
becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as usual; when 
you drop out of a Beastform, those marked Armor Slots remain 
marked. If you mark your last Hit Point, you automatically drop out 
of this form.

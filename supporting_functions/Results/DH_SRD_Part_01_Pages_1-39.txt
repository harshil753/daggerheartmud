Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025QUICKSTART ADVENTURE
INTRODUCTION
Welcome to Daggerheart!  In this quickstart adventure, 
you'll find the tools you need to play your first session of the 
game. This document does not contain every rule, so we highly 
recommend having the core rulebook accessible.
Before you begin, you’ll need 3-6 players. 2-5 of those 
players will be PCs, or player characters. They will create a 
character who will inhabit the world. One player will be the 
game master, or GM, who is in charge of representing the 
world at large, asking questions, adjudicating dice rolls, and 
leading the narrative. In normal play, PCs would make their 
own characters and the GM would build their own story. For 
the quickstart adventure, both portions are already prepared. 
We highly recommend the GM read through each page on 
their own before players arrive. For more information about 
the game, or to purchase the core rulebook, visit us at  
www.daggerheart.com. 
MATERIALS
Along with a printed version of this Quickstart Adventure 
packet, you’ll need:
• A pencil for each player, and a pair of scissors.
• A set of polyhedral dice: 4-sided (d4), 6-sided (d6), 
8-sided (d8), 10-sided (d10), 12-sided (d12) and twenty-
sided (d20). Ideally, one set per player.
• A set of two d12s of different colors. Ideally, one set per 
player.
• A handful of character tokens, at least 7 for each player. 
These can be anything small you have lying around that 
won’t be confused for dice (buttons, pennies, chits, etc.).
• 12 Fear tokens for the GM. These can be anything small 
you have lying around that won't be confused for dice.
GETTING STARTED
Start by having the GM read The Sablewood Messengers  
section on the right side of this page aloud.THE SABLEWOOD MESSENGERS
“Marlowe Fairwind, the right-hand sorcerer of King Emeris, 
has gathered her most trusted allies to carry an important 
package to Hush, a small village within the ancient forest of 
Sablewood. The crate is large, heavy and sealed with magic,  
addressed to the Whitefire Arcanist. You’ve been given a 
map and a carriage, and the promise of reward upon your 
arrival.”
CHOOSING CHARACTERS
There are five pre-generated characters to choose from in 
this Quickstart Adventure. The GM should read the options 
to the players and have them take the four page character 
packet of the one they would like to play:
Marlowe F airwind, the Loreborne Elf Sorcerer 
She is the personal mage to King Emeris, and is responsible 
for bringing this group together. She appears calm, until she 
isn’t. Marlowe must be played during this adventure.
Barnacle, the Underborne Ribbet Rogue
There is no danger he will not get into, and no situation he 
cannot get out of. He fears water and will not swim.
Garrick Reed, the Highborne Human Warrior 
A defector from a distant military force, he approaches most 
conflict with a “kill ‘em with kindness” attitude.
Khari Nix, the Ridgeborne Giant Guardian 
Loyal to the end, with a dry sense of humor, she will suffer no 
fools. Khari was practically born with an axe in her hand.
Varian Soto, the Wildborne Katari Ranger
They take a “shoot first, ask questions later” approach. Any 
problem that can’t be solved with a bow, isn’t a problem yet.
Then give the game master their GM packet to continue.

LOREBORNE ELF SORCERER
Character Overview
Marlowe F airwind is the personal mage 
to King Emeris, and is responsible 
for bringing this group together. She 
appears calm, until she isn’t.
BREAKDOWN
Community:  Marlowe is part of the 
Loreborne community, meaning 
she grew up in a place that values 
knowledge and learning.
Ancestry:  She is an elf, giving her 
long pointed ears and acutely attuned 
senses.
Class & Subclass:  As a Primal Origin 
Sorcerer, she can shape and change the 
magic she casts in unique ways.
Experience:  Marlowe has the 
experiences “Royal Mage” and “Not On 
My Watch.” She will be able to utilize 
these in play when they apply.
Weapon:  She wields a dualstaff that 
can hit targets in Far range and when 
successful, deals 1d6+3 magic damage.
Question:  Why do you think King 
Emeris trusts you more than anyone 
else to deliver this package?The Basics
Duality Dice: Two d12 dice of different 
colors. Choose one to represent Hope 
and one to represent Fear.
Action Rolls:  Most rolls you make will 
be action rolls. They use the Duality 
Dice. Roll them together, add any 
modifiers that apply, and tell the GM 
the total, as well as what die rolled 
higher. 
“I rolled a 10 on the Fear die, a 5 on the 
Hope die, and I have a 2 in Instinct, so 
that’s a 17 with Fear!”
Hope & Fear:  When you roll with Hope, 
mark a Hope on your character sheet. 
You’ll be able to spend any Hope you 
have to aid future rolls for you and your 
allies. When you roll with Fear, the GM 
gains a Fear. They can spend Fear to 
instigate or escalate challenges in the 
scene.
Attack Rolls:  When you make an 
attack on a target, it works just like an 
action roll, but you’ll use the character 
trait the weapon or spell calls for as 
your modifier. On a success, you’ll 
usually make a damage roll.
Damage Rolls:  Roll your damage dice 
and add their values together. Then tell 
the GM the value and type of damage 
you’re doing.
“I rolled a 5 plus 3, that’s 8 points of 
magic damage.”
These mechanics and more will be 
covered during the coming adventure! 
Character Sheet & Cards
On the next page, y ou’ll find the 
character sheet for Marlowe. To finish 
off the build, mark 2 Hope and a 
handful of gold. The third page will 
provide you with a guide for your 
character sheet. The fourth page is 
your starting loadout of cards, as well 
as some guidance on how to use them.
Character Standee
Cut out the standee below for Marlowe 
and fold the paper in half so that she 
can stand on her own on the table.

Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025This section denotes your class. Each class is made up 
of two domains . Yours are Arcana & Midnight . You’ll 
choose the majority of your abilities and spells  from 
these domains.This section gives you a place to record your name, 
pronouns, heritage (the combination of your community 
and ancestry), and subclass . There is also a space to 
record your level . 
This is where you record your Hope. You spend Hope to 
use an Experience  (details below), Help an Ally , use a 
Hope Feature , or initiate a Tag Team Roll . When you 
Help an Ally, you explain how you’re aiding them and roll 
a d6 advantage die they add to their action roll total. 
You start with 2 Hope marked.
Your class’s unique Hope Feature is in this section as well.
This is where you keep track of your gold  during a 
campaign. If you should mark your tenth handful , you 
instead mark a bag and erase all your handfuls. If you 
should mark your tenth bag, you instead mark a chest . 
You start with one handful marked.Inventory  is where you will store all of your items  and 
consumables . Your potion is a consumable, so if you use 
it, make sure to cross it out here.
Every class starts with a unique Class Feature  that set 
them apart from other classes. Make sure to read through 
them before you begin playing.
This is where you would store any weapons  you want 
to carry, but not have active. While in your inventory, 
Features from these weapons are not useable or 
applicable.Experience  represents the particular specializations 
your character has. These are narrative tags that you 
create to reflect what your character is skilled in. When 
they apply to the scene, you can spend Hope  before the 
action roll to add their value as a modifier. You will earn 
more of these throughout a campaign, but you start with 
“Royal Mage” and “Not On My Watch.”This is the section for your armor. Along with a name , 
armor has base thresholds  that contribute to your 
damage thresholds, and a base score  that contributes 
to your Armor Score. The armor’s feature describes its 
special abilities or the requirements to use it.Evasion represents your ability to avoid an attack. Yours 
is 10. The GM rolls against this number when determining 
if an adversary hits you. If you do get hit, you can choose 
to mark an Armor Slot  (the small empty shields to the 
right of the large “Armor” shield) to reduce the severity 
of the incoming damage by one threshold. You have a 
number of available slots equal to your Armor Score  (the 
number in the large “Armor” shield). Yours is 3.This area contains your six character traits . These are 
what you will use as your primary modifiers on action 
rolls. They have descriptions beneath each to remind you 
how to use them.
The two smaller boxes are your damage thresholds . 
These come from your armor, and you always add your 
level to their value. When you take damage, compare it to 
the numbers here. If the incoming damage is Minor , you 
mark a Hit Point . If it is Major , you mark 2 Hit Points . If 
it is Severe , you mark 3 Hit Points . If you ever need to 
mark Stress and can’t, mark a Hit Point . If you ever mark 
your last Hit Point, you must make a death move .This is the section for your active weapons . Along with a 
name, weapons have an associated trait that you will roll 
when using them for an attack. They also have a range  
(Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, or Very Far ). The GM will tell 
you what range a target is in. Damage dice  are what kind 
of dice you’re rolling when you make a successful attack, 
and the type is either physical  or magic . Proficiency  
tells you how many damage dice you roll. The Feature  on 
a weapon gives you any special ability or requirement it 
has. 
Weapons are either one-handed or two-handed. You'll 
see the appropriate amount of hands are already filled for 
the weapon you've taken.
Marlowe carries a Dualstaff that deals 1d6+3 magic 
damage to any adversaries you succeed against.

A defector from a distant military force, 
he approaches most conflict with a “kill 
‘em with kindness” attitude.
BREAKDOWN
Community:  Garrick is part of the 
Highborne community, meaning he was 
born into a life of elegance, opulence, 
and prestige.  
Ancestry:  He is a human, giving him 
rounded ears and a natural endurance.
Class & Subclass:  As a Call of the 
Brave Warrior, he can steel himself 
before battle to gain a tactical 
advantage.
Experience:  Garrick has the 
experiences “Affable” and “Hit Them 
Hard.” He will be able to utilize these in 
play when they apply.
Weapon:  He wields a longsword that 
can hit targets in Melee range and 
when successful, deals 1d8+3 physical 
damage.
Question:  What has Marlowe asked of 
you previously that made this mission 
difficult to say yes to?The Basics
Duality Dice:  Two d12 dice of different 
colors. Choose one to represent Hope 
and one to represent Fear.
Action Rolls:  Most rolls you make will 
be action rolls. They use the Duality 
Dice. Roll them together, add any 
modifiers that apply, and tell the GM 
the total, as well as what die rolled 
higher. 
“I rolled a 10 on the Fear die, a 5 on the 
Hope die, and I have a 2 in Agility, so 
that’s a 17 with Fear!”
Hope & Fear:  When you roll with Hope, 
mark a Hope on your character sheet. 
You’ll be able to spend any Hope you 
have to aid future rolls for you and your 
allies. When you roll with Fear, the GM 
gains a Fear. They can spend Fear to 
instigate or escalate challenges in the 
scene.
Attack Rolls:  When you make an 
attack on a target, it works just like an 
action roll, but you’ll use the character 
trait the weapon or spell calls for as 
your modifier. On a success, you’ll 
usually make a damage roll.
Damage Rolls:  Roll your damage dice 
and add their values together. Then tell 
the GM the value and type of damage 
you’re doing.
“I rolled a 6 plus 3, so that’s 9 points of 
physical damage.”
These mechanics and more will be 
covered during the coming adventure!

Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025This section denotes your class. Each class is made up of 
two domains.  Yours are Blade & Bone . You’ll choose the 
majority of your abilities and spells  from these domains.This section gives you a place to record your name, 
pronouns, heritage (the combination of your community 
and ancestry), and subclass . There is also a space to 
record your level . 
This is where you record your Hope. You spend Hope to 
use an Experience  (details below), Help an Ally , use a 
Hope Feature , or initiate a Tag Team Roll . When you 
Help an Ally, you explain how you’re aiding them and roll 
a d6 advantage die they add to their action roll total. 
You start with 2 Hope marked.
Your class’s unique Hope Feature is in this section as well.
This is where you keep track of your gold  during a 
campaign. If you should mark your tenth handful , you 
instead mark a bag and erase all your handfuls. If you 
should mark your tenth bag, you instead mark a chest . 
You start with one handful marked.Inventory  is where you will store all of your items  and 
consumables . Your potion is a consumable, so if you use 
it, make sure to cross it out here.
Every class starts with a unique Class Feature  that sets 
them apart from other classes. Make sure to read through 
them before you begin playing.
This is where you would store any weapons  you want 
to carry, but not have active. While in your inventory, 
Features from these weapons are not useable or 
applicable.Experience  represents the particular specializations 
your character has. These are narrative tags that you 
create to reflect what your character is skilled in. When 
they apply to the scene, you can spend Hope  before the 
action roll to add their value as a modifier. You will earn 
more of these throughout a campaign, but you start with 
“Affable” and “Hit Them Hard.”This is the section for your armor. Along with a name , 
armor has base thresholds  that contribute to your 
damage thresholds, and a base score  that contributes 
to your Armor Score. The armor’s feature describes its 
special abilities or the requirements to use it.Evasion represents your ability to avoid an attack. Yours 
is 11. The GM rolls against this number when determining 
if an adversary hits you. If you do get hit, you can choose 
to mark an Armor Slot  (the small empty shields to the 
right of the large “Armor” shield) to reduce the severity 
of the incoming damage by one threshold. You have a 
number of available slots equal to your Armor Score  (the 
number in the large “Armor” shield). Yours is 3. This area contains your six character traits . These are 
what you will use as your primary modifiers on action 
rolls. They have descriptions beneath each to remind you 
how to use them.
The two smaller boxes are your damage thresholds . 
These come from your armor, and you always add your 
level to their value. When you take damage, compare it to 
the numbers here. If the incoming damage is Minor , you 
mark a Hit Point . If it is Major , you mark 2 Hit Points . If 
it is Severe , you mark 3 Hit Points . If you ever need to 
mark Stress and can’t, mark a Hit Point . If you ever mark 
your last Hit Point, you must make a death move .This is the section for your active weapons . Along with a 
name, weapons have an associated trait that you will roll 
when using them for an attack. They also have a range  
(Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, or Very Far ). The GM will tell 
you what range a target is in. Damage dice  are what kind 
of dice you’re rolling when you make a successful attack, 
and the type is either physical  or magic . Proficiency  
tells you how many damage dice you roll. The Feature  on 
a weapon gives you any special ability or requirement it 
has. 
Weapons are either one-handed or two-handed. You'll 
see the appropriate amount of hands are already filled for 
the weapon you've taken.
Garrick carries a Longsword that deals 1d8+3 physical 
damage to any adversaries you succeed against.

Duality Dice:  Two d12 dice of different 
colors. Choose one to represent Hope 
and one to represent Fear.
Action Rolls:  Most rolls you make will 
be action rolls. They use the Duality  
Dice. Roll them together, add any 
modifiers that apply, and tell the GM

Hope die, and I have a 2 in Strength, so 
that’s a 17 with Fear!”

Attack Rolls:  When you make an

your modifier. On a success, you’ll 
usually make a damage roll.
Damage Rolls:  Roll your damage dice 
and add their values together. Then tell 
the GM the value and type of damage 
you’re doing.
“I rolled a 7 plus 3, that’s 10 points of

yet.
BREAKDOWN

were raised by a clan hidden deep 
within the forest.

you been hunting for years that you’re 
hoping to see while in the Sablewood?The Basics
Duality Dice:  Two d12 dice of different 
colors. Choose one to represent Hope 
and one to represent Fear.
Action Rolls:  Most rolls you make will 
be action rolls. They use the Duality  
Dice. Roll them together, add any 
modifiers that apply, and tell the GM 
the total, as well as what die rolled 
higher.  
“I rolled a 10 on the Fear die, a 5 on the 
Hope die, and I have a 2 in Agility, so 
that’s a 17 with Fear!”

your modifier. On a success, you’ll 
usually make a damage roll.
Damage Rolls:  Roll your damage dice 
and add their values together. Then tell 
the GM the value and type of damage 
you’re doing.
“I rolled a 5 plus 3, that’s 8 points of 
physical damage.”

Features from these weapons are not useable or 
applicable.Experience  represents the particular specializations 
your character has. These are narrative tags that you 
create to reflect what your character is skilled in. When

more of these throughout a campaign, but you start with 
“Deadly Aim” and “Nature’s Friend.”This is the section for your armor. Along with a name , 
armor has base thresholds  that contribute to your 
damage thresholds, and a base score  that contributes 
to your Armor Score. The armor’s feature describes its 
special abilities or the requirements to use it. The armor’s 
feature describes its special abilities or the requirements 
to use it.Evasion represents your ability to avoid an attack. Yours 
is 13. The GM rolls against this number when determining 
if an adversary hits you. If you do get hit, you can choose 
to mark an Armor Slot  (the small empty shields to the 
right of the large “Armor” shield) to reduce the severity 
of the incoming damage by one threshold. You have a 
number of available slots equal to your Armor Score  (the 
number in the large “Armor” shield). Yours is 3.
The two smaller boxes are your damage thresholds . 
These come from your armor, and you always add your 
level to their value. When you take damage, compare it to 
the numbers here. If the incoming damage is Minor , you 
mark a Hit Point . If it is Major , you mark 2 Hit Points . If 
it is Severe , you mark 3 Hit Points . If you ever need to 
mark Stress and can’t, mark a Hit Point . If you ever mark 
your last Hit Point, you must make a death move .This is the section for your active weapons . Along with a 
name, weapons have an associated trait that you will roll 
when using them for an attack. They also have a range  
(Melee, Very Close, Close, Far, or Very Far ). The GM will tell 
you what range a target is in. Damage dice  are what kind 
of dice you’re rolling when you make a successful attack, 
and the type is either physical  or magic . Proficiency  
tells you how many damage dice you roll. The Feature  on 
a weapon gives you any special ability or requirement it 
has. 
Weapons are either one-handed or two-handed. You'll 
see the appropriate amount of hands are already filled for 
the weapon you've taken.

INTRODUCTION
Welcome to the Game Master’s section of the Quickstart 
Adventure Guide! If you’re here, you’re probably about to run 
the Sablewood Messengers quickstart adventure for your 
players. Whether you’ve run numerous TTRPGs in the past 
or this is your first time taking on the GM role, we’ll lead you 
through everything you need to know to have a successful 
first session of Daggerheart. It is recommended you read 
through this entire guide before beginning. You’ll also want to 
cut out all the Sablewood Messengers standees at the back 
of this guide and gather 12 tokens you can utilize to represent 
Fear during the game.
CHARACTER PACKET
After they receive their character packet, ensure your players 
read through the first page. It will give them the background 
information on their character. 
At the end of the Breakdown section, there will be a question 
for them to answer. Go around the table sharing the 
responses to each question. Then, ask the players to assign 
their Connections to other characters in the party. They may 
choose one, two, or all three. Encourage them to talk about 
why they’ve given these connections to each other, and 
build their relationships together. Take notes on anything 
that might be useful from their conversation to work into the 
adventure.
Then ask them to cut out their character standee, fold it, and 
place it next to them. Th ey’ll need it during combat.
FIELDING QUESTIONS
Your players may have questions about how aspects of 
their character sheet, cards, or the game works. If they 
ask something you don’t know yet, that’s okay! Remind 
them that this adventure is designed to teach everyone as 
you play together.THE SABLEWOOD
As your players look over the first page of their character 
packet, take a moment to read through the Sablewood 
summary below to familiarize yourself with the setting of this 
adventure. 
The Sablewood is a downloadable location designed for level 
one characters, so when you finish this adventure,  you can 
easily continue the story by exploring additional areas of the 
forest. For more about the Sablewood, visit  
www.daggerheart.com/downloads
SUMMARY
The Sablewood is a seemingly-endless forest of dark trees 
that reach hundreds of feet towards the sky—some say they 
have been here since the time before the Forgotten Gods . 
It’s famous for its unique hybrid animals, like the lemur-toads 
and tiger-elk, as well as its well-worn trade routes populated 
by traveling merchants. 
The hybrid animals in this place range from completely docile 
to extremely vicious. A cat-squirrel might come feed gently 
from your hand, while an eeligator would launch itself out of 
the nearby river to snap you up as an easy meal.
Within the Sablewood there is a small, friendly village known 
as Hush, the PCs' destination during this adventure. There 
are no inns within Hush. Any travelers passing through are 
treated as honored guests and invited to stay in the home of 
a member of the community. 
Many of the people of Hush (and the Sablewood at large) 
still worship the Forgotten Gods, despite having no names 
by which to call them. The Whitefire Arcanist  is the leader 
of Hush’s primary religious order and maintains the magic of 
the wards that protect the village.ADVENTURE GUIDE

GUIDING PLAYERS
MECHANICAL OVERVIEW
This section will cover the very basic mechanical elements of 
Daggerheart. Read the boxed sections aloud. As you do, ask 
the players to follow along.
We’re going to quickly cover the basics of what you 
need to know to start playing. First off, Daggerheart is a 
collaborative, narrative-focused roleplaying game. That 
means we'll all be working together to tell a story using the 
mechanics of the game as our foundation. You will each 
make choices for your characters during the adventure, and 
I will describe the rest of the world reacting around them. 
Sometimes I might ask you a question—what your character 
knows about a place or has heard about a person. I'll do my 
best to integrate your answers into the story we're telling, 
so that we're building this world together! 
Okay, let's turn to your Character Sheet. You’ll find an 
additional page underneath that we’ll call the “Sidecar.” 
Slide it out to the left until you reach the dotted line.
Character Sheets
You have a character sheet and an explainer sheet on pages 
25 and 26 to use as well. Use them to walk your players 
through their own character sheet, starting on the left side of 
the sidecar. Moving around the table, have each player read a 
section aloud. Then, slide the sidecar out to the right side and 
do this again. Once you’re finished, come back here.Rolling Dice
Before reading the next section, ask players to grab their dice 
and roll them with you.
ACTION ROLLS
Now that we’ve looked at our character sheets, let’s talk 
about how we roll the dice in Daggerheart. I’ll give you the 
basics and we’ll learn more as we go! First, grab your 2d12 
dice, called your Duality Dice. Decide which represents 
Hope and which represents Fear. 
When you have your character do something in the story 
that is dangerous or could result in consequences, I'll 
probably ask you to make an action roll. You’ll roll both of 
those d12 dice, and add the applicable character trait to 
the result. I’ll usually tell you which one it is, but sometimes 
I might ask you. If you want to, you may use some of the 
tokens you have to represent the modifier for a roll. 
Let’s say you are making an Agility roll and you have a +2 
in that trait—you’ll take 2 tokens into your hand and roll 
them along with your dice. Then, you’ll count everything up 
and tell me the result, along with which die rolled higher. 
For example, if you rolled a 6 on the Hope die and a 10 on 
the Fear die, that would be 16, plus the 2 tokens you rolled, 
bringing it to a total of 18. Because the Fear die rolled 
higher, you would tell me that you got an "18 with Fear."
If you roll with Hope, you mark a Hope on your sheet. If 
you roll with Fear, I gain a Fear and can make a GM move. 
This means I get to impact the flow of the narrative, usually 
to add some kind of complication to the scene. I start the 
game with a number of Fear equal to the number of players.
Take that number of Fear tokens to illustrate this.
Sometimes, you might have an E xperi ence that applies to a 
roll. Maybe you have “Expert Climber” and are attempting 
to scale a wall, or “Eagle Eye” and you’re trying to spot 
tracks in the dirt. You can spend a Hope before the roll to 
describe how that Experience helps you and add its value to 
your roll.
Lastly, let’s talk about Spellcast rolls. Those are action rolls 
using your Spellcast trait, which will be on your Subclass's 
Foundation card if you are a spellcaster. For example, 
Marlowe’s Spellcast Trait is Instinct.4 Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025This section denotes your class. Each class is made up 
of two domains. Yours are Arcana & Midnight. You’ll 
choose the majority of your abilities and spells from 
these domains.This section gives you a place to record your name, 
pronouns, heritage (the combination of your community 
and ancestry), and subclass. There is also a space to 
record your level . 
This is where you record your Hope. You spend Hope to 
use an Experience (details below), Help an Ally, use a 
Hope Feature, or initiate a Tag Team Roll. When you 
Help an Ally, you explain how you’re aiding them and roll 
a d6 advantage die they add to their action roll total. 
You start with 2 Hope marked.
Your class’s unique Hope Feature is in this section as well.
This is where you keep track of your gold during a 
campaign. If you should mark your tenth handful, you 
instead mark a bag and erase all your handfuls. If you 
should mark your tenth bag, you instead mark a chest.

mark a Hit Point. If it is Major, you mark 2 Hit Points. If 
it is Severe , you mark 3 Hit Points. If you ever need to 
mark Stress and can’t, mark a Hit Point. If you ever mark 
your last Hit Point, you must make a death move.This is the section for your active weapons. Along with a

HOW DICE ROLLS AFFECT THE STORY
Alright, we’ve talked about how we roll dice, let’s talk about 
what they do in the story! Usually, I’ll set a difficulty for the 
roll based on the situation, like 6 or 14 or 25, and your goal 
is to meet or beat that number. If an ability or spell has a 
number on it, like Spellcast Roll (13), that’s the difficulty of 
the roll.  If you succeed, you get what you wanted! If you 
don’t, you fail and something new happens in the story 
because of it. Hope and Fear also play a part in this: 
If you get a success with Hope , that means you accomplish 
your goal and all is well. You can continue to pass the scene 
around the table to the other players as you’d like. 
A success with Fear  means you do it, but there is a 
consequence or a complication, so I gain a Fear and can 
make what we call a “GM move.” This just means I’ll change 
the story in some way. You might have to mark a Stress, 
adversaries might attack, the environment might change, 
or you might only get part of what you wanted. The move I 
make will always aim to push the story we’re telling forward 
in an exciting way. 
If you roll a failure with Hope , you don’t get what you 
wanted, but things don’t go as badly as they could. I’ll make 
a move that matches the narrative, and then I’ll turn things 
back to the rest of the table. 
If you roll a failure with Fear , the situation goes very badly. 
I’ll gain a Fear and make a move that raises the stakes to 
highlight the consequences.
Saving the best for last, if you ever roll two of the same 
number, no matter what that number is, that is a critical 
success in Daggerheart. You get what you wanted and a 
little extra. You get to mark a Hope and you can also clear 
a Stress, if you have one. If it is an attack roll, you add the 
maximum your damage dice could roll as a modifier to your 
damage roll. For example, if you deal 1d8+4 damage, you’d 
add an additional 8 to the roll.COMBAT
Next, put some character and terrain standees on the table 
to simulate a battle map, and continue reading aloud.
Finally, we’re going to talk about combat. Sometimes when 
a fight breaks out, I'll put a map of some kind on the table to 
show where everybody is. When you want to attack a target, 
you’ll ask me if it is in range of your weapon. If it is, you can 
make an action roll with that weapon, using the trait it calls 
for. This is called an attack roll. If you succeed against the 
target, you’ll then make a damage roll. Look at the damage 
dice section of your weapon and roll the specified dice, then 
tell me the total and whether the damage is physical or 
magic. 
If any of your action rolls during combat are with Fear or are 
a failure, I will often use my GM move to put the spotlight on 
an adversary who is attacking you or doing something else 
important in the scene as the consequence. Additionally, 
I have the opportunity to spend Fear after that happens 
to shift the spotlight to an additional adversary or make 
another GM move. In most cases, I can't have the same 
enemy take the spotlight more than once in a GM turn, so 
after I'm out of adversaries to spotlight or I've spent as 
much Fear as I want to, I'll pass play back to you all to figure 
out what happens next. 
Combat functions just the same as the rest of the game, 
meaning there is no turn order you must go in. You all get to 
do what you'd like in the order you want to do it, and I get to 
make GM moves in response. Because of this, you shouldn't 
feel locked into only making an attack on the enemy once 
the fight breaks out. Remember to think about the scene 
and situation as a whole narrative moment, and consider 
what you could do to make the best story.

GM'S GUIDE
Review the mechanics and narrative on this page and the one 
following it. The quickstart adventure will lead you through what 
you need to know, but it will help to have a primer before you 
jump in.
MECHANICAL OVERVIEW
You always set a difficulty  before an action roll. Sometimes 
the difficulty will be noted by an adversary, other times you’ll 
have to make it up. Use the information below as guidance:
10 - Easy | 15 - Medium | 20 - Hard
Remember that when PCs roll with Hope, they gain a Hope, 
and when PCs roll with Fear, you gain a Fear.
You can always give advantage  or disadvantage  to a PC 
on a roll, if it makes sense in the situation. If a player has 
advantage, have them roll a d6 and add the value to their roll. 
If they have disadvantage, they instead subtract that value. 
When you have advantage as a GM, you roll an additional d20 
and take the higher result. When you have disadvantage, roll 
an additional d20 and take the lower one.
You can always make a GM move when the players roll 
a failure or with Fear, the narrative provides a golden 
opportunity, or the table looks to you for what happens next. 
Additionally, you can always spend a Fear to make a GM move 
when you normally wouldn't.
When you make a GM move, you should create a 
complication, signal that a new threat is on its way, reveal 
a new danger, spotlight an adversary, have the PC mark a 
Stress, or anything else that seems narratively relevant in the 
scene. 
During combat, you'll often use your GM move to spotlight 
an adversary. This means it is their turn to act, usually to 
move and/or attack a target in range of their weapon, or 
do something else important in the scene. Remember that 
you can always spend a Fear after spotlighting an adversary 
to shift the spotlight to another adversary, or make an 
additional GM move of your choice. You can typically only 
spotlight each adversary once per GM turn.
When an adversary attacks a PC , you’ll make an attack 
roll. Roll a d20 and add the adversary’s attack modifier, then 
ask if the total meets or beats the Evasion value on the PC’s 
character sheet. If it does, you’ll roll the damage dice and tell 
the PC what the value and type is. “That’s a 5 and a 3, so that’s 
8 points of physical damage.”
While in battle,  keep an eye on quieter players or those who 
are more hesitant to jump in on their own, and if needed, 
shift the spotlight their direction by asking them what they 
are doing in the scene.Ranges in the game are abstracted to common language and 
at your discretion, but if you’re playing with maps and minis, 
the list below is a good place to start:
• Melee is when two creatures are next to one another. 
• Very Close  is 5-10 feet, or anywhere on the map within 
the length of the short side of a playing card (about 3 
inches).
• Close is 10-30 feet, or anywhere on the map within the 
length of a standard pencil (about 6 inches).
• F ar is 30-100 feet, or anywhere within a letter-sized 
piece of paper’s longest length (about 12 inches).
• Very F ar  is anywhere beyond that, while still in the scene.
Movement during a player’s turn is only restricted if there 
is danger present in the scene. During combat, PCs can 
move anywhere within close range when they are making an 
action roll. If they want to move as their only action, or get 
somewhere beyond close range while danger is present, they 
should make an Agility roll to see if they get there safely.
Adversaries can move within close range and act (make an 
attack, etc.), or spend their spotlight moving anywhere else.
Below is a stat block  for an adversary in this adventure.
Thistlefolk Thief
Tier 1 Leader
Serrated Blade: Melee - 2d4+3 (phy)
ATK: +3
Difficulty: 14  Thresholds: 7/14

On the left side are their standard weapon attack, attack 
modifier, and the difficulty to hit the thief. On the right 
are their damage thresholds, hit points, and stress. On the 
bottom are their features, special moves they can make. 
Actions are moves the adversary can make that while in the 
spotlight, and Reactions tell you when to use them but often 
happen when an adversary is not already in the spotlight. 
Some features also require spending Fear.
Fear Guide
• Spend a Fear to interrupt the scene with a GM move.
• Spend a Fear to make an additional move during a GM 
turn .
• Spend a Fear to use an adversary's or environment's 
Fear move.

Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025NARRATIVE OVERVIEW
Act One:  
the merchant cart
On their way to Hush, the PCs run across an overturned 
merchant cart blocking their path. A strixwolf is feeding on 
the driver, who is dead.
Act Two:  
thicket thieves
The PCs are ambushed by Thistlefolk who try to steal the 
carriage holding the delivery. 
Act Three:  
seeking an arcanist
When the PCs arrive in Hush safely, they must track down the 
Whitefire Arcanist by talking to the townspeople. Act Four : 
the treehouse
Upon opening the crate, the package is revealed to be the 
keystone from the city gate’s main archway. King Emeris 
sent the stone to the Arcanist to repair the ward placed upon 
it that protects the city. The Arcanist asks for the PCs’ help 
holding off danger while she completes the ritual needed to 
repair its magic. 
Act Five:  
the ward renewal
The PCs take the stone to the ritual site and, while the 
Arcanist works her magic, fight off the magical creatures that 
begin to invade. 
ABOUT THE THISTLEFOLK
The Thistlefolk take up residence in the place where 
nobody else dares—within the thickest, thorniest bramble 
of the Sablewood. Because the only Thistlefolk who 
emerge from the seclusion of their hidden villages are 
often thieves coming out to steal goods from unwitting 
travelers or sleeping merchants, they have received a 
reputation for being a syndicate of criminals. In actuality, 
most of the Thistlefolk are quite docile and vulnerable, 
choosing to live within the safety of the bramble for their 
own protection from the large predator species who stalk 
the woods looking for an easy meal.  


29
Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025the merchant cart
ACT ONE
The Beginning
Read the following aloud to y our players:
This evening, your party finally made it to the Sablewood, 
a sprawling forest of colossal trees some say are even 
older than the Forgotten Gods. It’s a place renowned for 
two things—its sunken pathways that provide the trade 
routes for many traveling merchants, and its unique hybrid 
animals. Even now, from within your carriage, you can hear 
strange sounds: the low calls of the lark-moths, the croak of 
the lemur-toads, the scittering of a family of fox-bats in the 
underbrush. One of you is driving the carriage. Who is it?
When a player volunteers their character as the carriage 
driver, you can ask them a question like: 
You’ve noticed something unique about the look of trees 
here in the Sablewood. What is it?
Describe the trees the party passes, specifically including 
details from their answer. This is utilizing one of the GM 
Principles in Daggerheart, “Ask Questions and Incorporate 
the Answers.” Then, read the following aloud:
As your steeds pull the carriage around a tight corner, 
one wheel coming off the ground for just a moment, you 
see an overturned merchant’s cart laying sideways in the 
path before you, blocking your way. A scattering of fruits 
and vegetables litter the trail. From around the side of the 
carriage steps a strixwolf; a large creature with the body of 
a wolf, the face of an owl, and large wings adorning its back. 
It finishes chewing its meal, the hand of the dead merchant, 
as it stares at you, curious, trying to judge whether you’re 
friend or foe. Then you see, following clumsily behind, two 
small pups watching their mother cautiously. 
From within, the rest of you feel your carriage come to a 
stop. What would you like to do?
Allow the PCs to roleplay for a little bit if they’d like. When 
somebody approaches the merchant cart, that will trigger the 
first action roll. The First Action Roll
Read the follow ing aloud:
The strixwolf is wary of your movement. Let’s make our first 
roll to see how she reacts! This will be using your Presence 
trait, so grab your Duality Dice and roll them, then add your 
Presence. You can also spend a Hope before the roll to add 
an Experience, if it applies. Then tell me the total and which 
die rolled higher!
SUCCESS
If they rolled a 10 or higher,  it is a success! Describe the 
strixwolf calmly trying to keep her pups out of danger. 
If the roll was with Hope,  tell the player to gain a Hope.
If the roll was with Fear, gain a Fear. This is also your 
chance to introduce a consequence to the scene. It 
should not undermine the success, but rather forward the 
narrative in an exciting way. You might say:
The mother hoot-howls, as if calling to another strixwolf 
among the trees. You know you might not be alone for long.
F AILURE
If they rolled a 9 or below,  it is a failure. Describe the 
strixwolf snarling and snapping, angry that the PC is 
approaching.
If the roll was with Hope, tell the player to gain a Hope. You 
still get to make a GM move, but because it’s with Hope, it 
shouldn’t be as bad as it could be. You might say:
With one last snarl, she leans down to have her pups 
clamber onto her back before taking off into the air, landing 
on a nearby branch. She is watching your every move.
If the roll was with Fear, things go badly. Gain a Fear and 
describe the strixwolf snarling at the PC, causing them to 
mark a Stress.
CRITICAL SUCCESS
If both dice roll the same number, it’s a critical success! Tell 
the PC to mark a Hope. They can also clear a Stress, if they 
have one. Then, describe the strixwolf moving towards the 
PC, head down, tail wagging. It sits in front of them.

ACT TWO // PART ONE
The Fallout
Let the events of the previous act play out, allowing the 
players to roleplay and take other actions. Use the scenarios 
below for guidance.
SCENARIOS
If they search the merchant cart, you can talk about the 
cart being stripped of all valuables and showcase the dead 
driver with a mangled arm, picked over by the strixwolf 
family for food. If the PCs inspect the body further, they 
might find that the driver had his neck slit. 
If they attack the strixwolf, have them make an attack 
roll against it at a difficulty of 10. On a success, they deal 
damage using their weapon. The pups will flee.
If they fail any rolls to interact with the strixwolf, it 
will pull its pups onto its back and fly into a nearby tree, 
watching the adventurers from above.
If they try to find signs of something strange, they see 
the remnants of thorny bramble tangled around the wheel 
of the carriage and strewn across on the road.
If they want to move the merchant cart out of the way, 
are taking steps to get their carriage moving again, or 
are trying to leave the trail, jump to "Ambushed!"

The Ambush
When the moment feels right, or one of the above scenarios 
triggers it, ask a PC who seems like they are paying 
attention to their surroundings to make an Instinct Roll with 
a difficulty of 14. 
On a success , they notice eyes watching them from the 
darkness beyond the trail. If it was with Fear, gain a Fear 
and have the PC mark a Stress. Use the “See Them Coming” 
prompts.
On a failure, they are immediately ambushed. If it was with 
Fear, gain a Fear and have the PC also mark a Stress. Use the 
“Ambushed!” prompts.See Them Coming
Read the following aloud:
You hear the sounds of a branch snapping and turn to 
see four Thistlefolk sneaking through the underbrush, 
attempting to g et the jump on your party. The overturned 
cart was a distraction, but their plan didn’t work. I’m going 
to set up a map!
Ambushed!
Read the following aloud:
In a whirlwind of cracking branches and unsheathed 
blades, a group of four Thistlefolk jump out from the brush 
alongside the road. The overturned cart was an ambush! 
They stand before you, weapons drawn, blocking the road. 
They'll go first. I’m going to set up a battle map!
SETTING UP THE BATTLE MAP
Take the forest terrain you’ve cut out and ask for your 
players to help you spread it across the table to build a map. 
You may also encourage them to grab other items from 
around the room to add terrain to the map. Build out the 
playspace together.
Then, place the overturned merchant’s cart on the table and 
ask the players to put their miniatures nearby, where they 
think they would be in the scene, along with their carriage. 
Finally, take the Thistlefolk Ambusher standees and the 
Thistlefolk Thief, and put them in Close range of the PCs. 
BEGINNING THE ENCOUNTER
On the next page, you’ll find the stat blocks for the 
Ambushers and Thief. You’ll use those stat blocks to run 
the remainder of this encounter. Remember to make the 
battle your own. Decide what the Thistlefolk look like in 
detail, describe the scene as if the players were watching 
a movie or reading a book, and if you’re comfortable with 
it, ask them to participate in building out the scene as well. 
This can be as easy as asking them to describe their attack 
or their evasion in detail, but you might also involve them 
further—ask them what unique clothing item the Ambushers 
are all wearing, or the interesting fighting style they seem 
to employ.  You might also ask what level of violence the 
players are comfortable with. Are they looking to kill the 
enemies? Incapacitate them? Knock them out?

ACT TWO // PART TWO
The First Encounter
AMBUSHED!
If the players were ambushed, the Thistlefolk act first. We 
can see this reflected in their feature, “Ambush.” Read the 
following aloud:
Having the upper hand, the three Thistlefolk Ambushers 
rush you! Because of their Ambush feature, they get to 
make an attack immediately. This only happens when they 
enter the scene, so it won’t be like this every time. But right 
now, they are slashing at you with daggers, protected by 
armor made of polished stones.
Move the ambushers into melee with the PC closest to them. 
Then follow the attack guide below for each Ambusher.
SEE THEM COMING
If the players spotted the Ambushers coming, they get to act 
first. Read the following aloud:
You stand at the ready, having spotted the Thistlefolk before 
they could ambush you! You all get to act first, who wants to 
start us off?
Thistlefolk Ambusher (Reference)
Tier 1 Standard
Dagger: Melee - 1d8+5 phy

FEATURES
Ambush - Reaction : When the Ambusher enters the scene without being 
spotted first, they can immediately move into Melee with a target and 
make an attack against them. On a success, they strike with their dagger 
for 2d4+8 physical damage.

Use the Ambushers to keep the party’s attention while the 
thief attempts to steal their carriage.
USING REFERENCE STAT BLOCKS
On the Thistlefolk Ambusher, you’ll notice the stat block 
is listed as "Reference" with three other smaller stat 
blocks below it. This is how Daggerheart represents three 
adversaries that all have the same stats. Instead of repeating 
all of the information three times, it is in one centralized area.
AMBUSHER ATTACK GUIDE
When you make an attack against a PC, roll a d20 and add its 
attack modifier (+1), then compare it to the PC’s Evasion. If it 
hits, make a damage roll using 1d8+5. Ask them to compare 
the total to their damage thresholds, use armor if they'd like, 
and mark their hit point(s). 
THIEF ATTACK GUIDE
When you make an attack against a PC, roll a d20 and add its 
attack modifier (+3), then compare it to the PC’s Evasion. If it 
hits, make a damage roll using 2d4+3. Ask them to compare 
the total to their damage thresholds, use armor if they'd 
like, and mark their hit points. If they’re using Back Off, on 
a success deal the damage and move the PC’s standee a 
direction of your choice in far range of where they previou sly 
were.
AMBUSHER/THIEF DEFENSE GUIDE
When an adversary is hit with damage, compare the amount 
to their thresholds, then mark the appropriate hit points. 
When you mark their last hit point, they are defeated.

The encounter ends when all adversaries are defeated.  
Clean up the map, then encourage the PCs to describe a 
montage of the remaining travel time to Hush.

ACT THREE
Arrival in Hush
Read the following alo ud:
The path leads you further into the forest until you spot a 
large stone pillar, carved top to bottom in ancient dwarven 
symbols. This denotes one corner of the peaceful village of 
Hush. When you pass beyond the stone marker, you feel a 
small sensation like the pop of a bubble, then the sounds of 
friendly chatter become louder. 
Though the trees of the Sablewood are unchanged here, 
there is a distinctive safe and comforting air. A few smiling 
faces turn to you as your carriage rolls in, waving or 
casting a warm greeting toward the party. There is lively 
music drifting your direction from the tavern at the center 
of town.
You know you need to find the Whitefire Arcanist to deliver 
the package from the King. What would you like to do?
If the players would like to talk to an NPC, you can choose 
one of the options below.
Fidget - Wildborne Human - (they/them)
A young child who will not stop wiggling—it’s clear how they earned 
their name. They are often busy scurrying up the trees in town, lighting 
the lanterns that hang from the branches. They know the fastest ways 
through the village. If the PCs approach, they are curious what life is like 
outside of Hush.
Lausa Standworth - Wildborne Dwarf - (she/her)
An older woman with a thick beard carrying a barrel of ale. She is happy 
to stand and talk to the party (she will keep the barrel on her shoulder 
the entire time). If the PCs approach, she wants to know the name of 
every member of the party’s weapons and the date they were forged.
Halython Fives - Loreborne Clank - (he/him)
A soft-spoken clank (a humanoid robot) of indeterminate age. He bears 
a number of small scratches across his metallic shoulder where an alert 
but friendly fox-bat rests. He is playing an unknown game that uses 
cards and acorns. If the PCs approach, he is curious about the Thistlefolk 
and asks if you encountered any on your way.
 
During their discussion, choose an additional NPC from the 
list above. The second will be a friend that has knowledge of 
where the Whitefire Arcanist lives. They last saw this person 
at the tavern and send you in its direction. 
For example, your PCs might meet Fidget in town. After 
some conversation and coaxing, Fidget points the party to 
the tavern to meet Lausa. The Clover Tavern
Read the following  aloud:
The Clover Tavern is a sight to behold, with six curving 
stories climbing the trunk of an ancient tree. This is the 
heart of the community, always crowded with music 
and good-natured conversation. Newcomers to the bar 
must take off their shoes and hang them over a line that 
stretches across the bar’s ground floor. Inevitably, by the 
time visitors leave, their shoes will be shined and filled with 
small trinkets. As you enter, what would you like to do?
Let the players roleplay here for a bit, introduce them to 
a barkeep or a friendly local who asks them to hang their 
shoes on the line. Let them explore the different levels of 
the tavern, and if you feel comfortable, ask some of your 
players to participate in describing details about it. 
How does the second floor of this tavern look so wildly 
different than the first? What smell permeates the air 
throughout this place? What unique custom do the locals 
seem to participate in every time you walk in the room?
OPTIONAL  - THE FIRSTMOSS FESTIVAL
If they ask around, the PCs will find out the people of 
Hush are currently celebrating the Firstmoss Festival—the 
time when the new crops in the Sunless Farms have the 
first layer of moss growing upon them, meaning they’re 
beginning to ripen for the season. It’s a celebration of 
the arrival of spring, and of the abundance of fresh fruits 
and vegetables the town will soon have. There is a good-
natured arm wrestling competition, a stone-painting 
class, and a small marketplace full of homemade trinkets. 
When you’re ready, guide the players in finding an NPC who 
will help them. If they bypassed asking someone in town, 
just use one of the NPCs from the list here instead. After a 
few exchanges, you can have the NPC say something like:
The Arcanist is quite busy, but if you’ve traveled so far, 
I’m sure she’ll be more than hospitable. We would be lost 
without her. She keeps this whole place protected by a 
powerful ward so that no dangers from the Sablewood can 
pass into town. You’ll find her house to the south, through 
the farmland. It’s hanging from one of the old Sablewood 
trees, you can’t miss it. 
When the PCs are ready, set them off towards the Arcanist.

33
Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025the treehouse
ACT FOUR
The Whitefire Arcanist
Read the following aloud:
Making your way past the homes of the village, then 
through the farmlands of Hush, you see a variety of crops 
that have begun to cultivate a thin layer of glowing blue 
moss over the top of their fruits and vegetables. They pulse 
softly like a heartbeat as you pass.
Among the thriving groves, you notice that the Sablewood 
trees in this area have hundreds of unique faces carved into 
all sides, the eyes peering in every direction. 
One tree, taller than the rest, bears the Arcanist’s home, 
like an overripe fruit. It hangs from a braid of rope, as wide 
around as a giant’s forearm, tied to a massive branch and 
counterweighted by a cabin-sized bolder lying at the base 
of the tree. The stone is marked with a collection of symbols 
and the cabin windows flash with a soft, yellow-green light. 
What would you all like to do?
Give the players the option to roleplay and problem solve. 
Use the section below as guidance, or create your own.
• If they try to call to the Arcanist from below,  there is 
no response, but the light within still flickers.
• If they try to cut the counterweight rope,  it will  
immediately blast them backwards a few feet, dealing a 
point of Stress.
• If they try to climb the tree,  its an Agility Roll with a 
difficulty of 13. On a failure, a limb of the tree grabs them, 
gently sets them down on the forest floor, then resumes 
its original form.When they finally do something to successfully get the 
Arcanist’s attention,  use the following to describe her as 
she emerges from her cabin to greet them.
A seven-foot mix of humanoid and firefly, the Arcanist is 
a faerie that moves in a combination of both very slow 
and suddenly jerky motions. Though her expressions are 
difficult to read, her emotions are very clear in her voice. 
She is old but spry, and she eyes the group mischieviously. 
“Are you the group Emeris sent from the capital? Oh my, 
you’re rather late aren’t you. Come in, come in.”
As the Arcanist lowers her home and invites you inside, 
you’ll notice the treehouse is surprisingly spacious. The 
main room is a crowd of potion bottles, spellbooks, runes, 
plants, and small creatures of all kinds. But, no one could 
classify this place as messy. It’s clear that if anyone moved 
a single item even an inch, the old faerie would notice.
The Package
Let the players roleplay with the Arcanist. Make her curious 
about their journey, the NPC who directed them towards her 
house, and how each of them have imagined they might die 
one day. 
Once she’s had enough conversation, the Arcanist will ask 
about the package from King Emeris. In order to inspect it 
in safety, she will magically unfold her home as if it were a 
blossoming flower. She’ll hurry the players to get the crate 
inside before closing the cabin back up, now just a bit bigger. 
When she opens the delivery, read the section below aloud:
Inside King Emeris’ package lies a massive stone with a 
lion’s face carved into it. Marlowe, you recognize this as 
the keystone of the capital city gate’s main archway. The 
Arcanist nods sagely as soon as she sees it, saying: “Of 
course the King would keep this delivery secret. If anyone 
knew your city was no longer warded, you would be 
conquered before sunrise.” With this ominous warning, she 
starts to unfurl her treehouse yet again. “We must travel 
to the Open Vale to revitalize the ward. But such an effort 
of magic will attract dangerous creatures from the darkest 
reaches of the Sablewood. I’ll need your help.”
If the players seem enthusiastic about helping, you should 
cut straight to the Open Vale, transitioning into Act Five. 
Otherwise, you can encourage the players to describe their 
time traveling with the eccentric Whitefire Arcanist.


34
Daggerheart © Darrington Press 2025THE WARD RENEWAL
ACT FIVE // PART ONE
The Open Vale
Read the following aloud:
On direction from the Arcanist, your carriage pulls into a 
mysterious clearing in the shape of a perfect circle, the only 
area of the Sablewood you’ve seen without trees to block 
out the sky. This is the Open Vale.
Speak to the players as the Arcanist, describing the Open 
Vale as a place used for strong ritual magic. It’s where she 
first forged the ward pillars that reside on all four corners of 
Hush, keeping the village safe. She almost died in that ritual, 
but is reluctant to say more for fear of angering the Forgotten 
Gods. Engage the PCs in conversation, then when you’re 
ready, read the following:
The Arcanist’s antennae perk up in a disconcerting way. 
“This is good. Stop, stop. Yes, here. Now come help me, I’m 
old.” This time, she unfolds the carriage as she did with her 
home and stands over the crate, humming. Her body starts 
to glow brighter, flickering in the night. 
“I will need an hour of time to prepare. You all, enjoy the 
night air while you can. We’ll be very busy soon.”
A Short Rest 
Tell the PCs that they will now take a short rest.
During a short rest, a PC may choose up to two of the 
following options. They may choose the same option twice.
TEND TO WOUNDS
Describe how you patch yourself up and clear 1d4+1 hit 
points. You may also tend to an ally instead.
CLEAR STRESS
Describe how you blow off steam or pull yourself together, 
and clear 1d4+1 Stress.
REPAIR ARMOR
Describe how you spend time quickly repairing your armor 
and clear 1d4+1 marked Armor Slots. You may also repair 
an ally’s armor instead. 
PREPARE
Describe how you prepare yourself for the path ahead and 
gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one or more 
members of your party, you may each take two Hope.GM PREP DURING REST
While the PCs are resting, take 1d4 Fear as your downtime 
benefit, then review the stat blocks for adversaries located 
below and on the next page. These will be used in the final 
battle.

hit point. Otherwise, they are defeated. 
Their Group Attack Feature allows you to activate several 
skeletons at once to make a powerful attack. When you 
use this action as your GM move, you must spend a Fear to 
activate the group attack, then move all skeletons in close 
range of a target into melee with them. Make one attack roll 
with a +0 modifier against the PC's Evasion. On a success, 
deal 4 phy damage per skeleton. Add all of this damage up 
before dealing it to the PC.

ACT FIVE // PART TWO
The Ritual Begins
Read the following aloud:
The Arcanist lets out a shrill cry, “The keystone has finally 
responded! Quickly, surround me, the ritual must begin 
or I’ll lose the pathway! Hurry!” Her body begins glowing 
brighter and brighter still as her eyes roll backwards into 
her head and the entire carriage lifts a foot off the ground. 
A collection of unearthly screeches echo from the woods as 
nearby creatures are alerted to the arcane energy.
Then place the Whitefire Arcanist standee at the center of 
the table. Ask the players to also place their standees in 
the scene. Finally, place four Ancient Skeletons within close 
range of the Arcanist and two Forest Wraiths within far range, 
then read the following aloud.
You feel a rumble as four ancient skeletons emerge from 
the ground, rusted swords in hand, disturbed by the forces 
of magic being used by the Arcanist. In the distance, two 
Forest Wraiths float ominously towards you. I’m going to 
start a countdown die for the ritual, your goal is to hold off 
the enemies until her work is completed. 
Grab a d8 and set it on the table with the 8 facing up. This is 
a countdown die. It will tick down one number every time an 
adversary is defeated. It will tick up every time the Whitefire 
Arcanist is hit with an attack. When the countdown reaches 0, 
the ritual is complete and the fight will end. 
ENVIRONMENT FEATURE
Environments can have their own features that let you 
utilize them in a unique way. For this encounter, you have an 
environment feature called Vengeance of the Vale.
The Open Vale
Tier: 1 Type: Exploration
FEATURES
Vengeance of the Vale - Action: Spend a Fear to summon two additional 
ancient skeletons from the ground within very close range of a PC.
ENCOUNTER GM GUIDANCE
The countdown progresses every time an adversary 
is defeated, so if it's not moving quickly enough, use 
Vengeance of the Vale  to spawn more skeletons, as they're 
easy to take down. Have adversaries target the Whitefire 
Arcanist if no other PCs are within attack range. Her difficulty 
is 11. She doesn't mark Hit Points or Stress, any damage done 
to her should be purely narrative.  FOREST WRAITH BATTLE GUIDE
Forest Wraiths can attack from far range with a +3 attack 
modifier. On a success, they deal 2d6+8 magic damage. They 
have resistance  to physical damage, meaning any incoming 
physical damage is cut in half (rounded up).
Their Memory Delve  move makes the target Vulnerable, 
which means all rolls you make against them are at 
advantage (roll an additional d20 and take the highest 
result). This condition doesn’t stack.
Pass-Through  should be used sparingly to avoid 
incapacitating the whole party at once. Because this move 
knocks a PC out of their body and stops them from acting 
until an adversary is taken down, using the Vengeance of the 
Vale Encounter Move can be a useful way to generate new, 
easily defeatable adversaries to avoid this from happening.
Forest Wraith (Reference)
Tier 1 Bruisers
Lifedrain - Far - 2d6+8 mag  
Attack Modifier: +3  
Difficulty: 13  Major 7 | Severe 14  
HP: 6  
Stress: 3
FEATURES
Spectral Body - Passive:  The Forest Wraith has resistance to physical 
damage.
Memory Delve - Action: Make an attack roll against a close target. On a 
success, the Forest Wraith flies into Melee and places their hand upon the 
target’s cheek. Ask the player to describe a terrifying moment from their 
character’s childhood. Then deal 3d4+9 magic damage and make them 
Vulnerable  until their next rest.
Pass-Through - Action:  Spend a Fear and make an attack roll against 
a target in Melee. On a success, the Forest Wraith passes through the 
target, pushing their soul from their body momentarily, making them 
Untethered . They cannot act again until the Ritual Countdown ticks down, 
clearing this condition. 
If the entire party becomes Untethered at the same time, they all mark 2 
Hit Points and their souls return, clearing the condition.

Forest Wraith #2
HP: O O O O O O  Stress: O O O
DEATH MOVE
If a PC ever marks their last hit point, they make a death 
move. For the purposes of the Quickstart Adventure, they fall 
unconscious until they are healed or the danger passes.
The Ritual Ends
When the Ritual Die ticks down to 0, move to the Epilogue.

EPILOGUE
The Keystone Ward
Read the following aloud:
As you deliver a powerful blow, the ritual ends! The carriage 
comes falling to the ground as the keystone vibrates with 
arcane energy. Then, all at once, a soundless explosion 
erupts from the Whitefire Arcanist, dissipating any last 
enemies who might remain. The clearing is quiet once 
again.
Back inside the treehouse, not but an hour later, the 
keystone sits suspended carefully above a rumbling fire in 
the hearth.
The Arcanist, who looks even older now than she did before, 
sits cross-legged in an over-stuffed chair. There is an 
exhaustion in her voice as she speaks.
“You fought hard. I’m not surprised, of course. The King 
keeps good company. I’m very glad you were there.”
Give the PCs the chance to wrap up their story with the 
Arcanist. When conversation stalls or the PCs ask about the 
keystone, you might say something like:
“The keystone will need a week, maybe more, to allow the 
magic to settle. I’ll need to watch it carefully to ensure 
nothing cracks or becomes sentient or anything of the like. 
You know how it is. And in the meantime, after you rest and 
gather yourselves, have a nice hot meal and warm bath, I 
have one more thing to ask of you.”
We pull out of the Arcanist’s home, out of the forest itself, 
to view the verdant expanse from above, and see twisting 
stone spires breaking through the treeline, each with 
a flame flickering within the tower like a beacon. She 
continues:
“There’s a Spire, just west of here, maybe a few hours walk. 
I felt it on the way to the ritual. Its power was... strange. The 
light felt weaker than it should be. I think something might 
be terribly wrong with the Spirekeeper, and I fear what will 
happen if its fire is extinguished altogether. When you’re 
ready, come back, and I’ll give you my map so you can make 
it there safely. It’s good to have heroes in the Sablewood 
again.”
And that’s where we’re going to end today’s session.Beyond the Adventure

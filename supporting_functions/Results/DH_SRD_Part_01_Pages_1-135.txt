Daggerheart SRD

INTRODUCTION
Welcome to DAGGERHEART, a collaborative fantasy tabletop roleplaying game of incredible 
magic and heroic, heartfelt adventure.
WHAT IS THIS?
This is the Daggerheart SRD (System Reference Document). It 
is a repository of the mechanical elements of the Daggerheart 
system, edited and organized for clarity, conciseness, and 
quick reference.
You can use this SRD in several ways:
â¢ T o quickly look up Daggerheartâs rules-as-written during 
gameplay sessions.
â¢ T o ensure any homebrew content you create or publish 
conforms with Daggerheartâs core ruleset.
â¢ T o provide copy text made available by Darrington Press 
for your own publications under their Community Gaming 
License ( www.darringtonpress.com/license ).
â¢ T o better understand the mechanics of Daggerheart, 
absent the flavor and setting information, so you can bend 
or break them in the process of making your own content.
The Daggerheart SRD is not a replacement for the core 
rulebook, which contains setting information, additional 
examples of various gameplay elements, and tons of great 
advice for playing Daggerheartânot to mention gorgeous 
artwork and layout.
In short, it is Daggerheart, the system, boiled down to the 
bonesâa lean and clean offering without all the flavor, style, 
and supporting material that makes the core rulebook such an 
evocative and enjoyable read. We hope this document proves 
useful to your table. Happy adventuring!
THE BASICS
WHAT IS DAGGERHEART?
Daggerheart is a tabletop roleplaying game for one Game 
Master (âGMâ) and 2-5 players. Each game session lasts about 
2-4 hours, and Daggerheart can be played as a one-shot or a 
multi-session campaign of any length. 
During a session of Daggerheart the GM describes situations, 
narrates events, and controls any adversaries or obstacles 
that the Player Characters (âPCsâ) encounter. The players, in 
turn, roleplay their PCsâ reactions to the scenario presented by 
the GM. If the outcome of a playerâs action depends on fate or 
fortune, the GM calls for an action roll.
When a player makes an action roll, they utilize Duality 
Diceâtwo differently colored 12-sided dice (âd12sâ) 
representing Hope and Fear. The Duality Dice are rolled, 
relevant modifiers are added to the results, and the total is 
compared to a Difficulty set by the GM. If the total meets or 
beats the Difficulty, the player succeeds. If itâs lower, they fail. 
In addition, the situation changes based on which Duality Die 
rolls higher, either giving the player helpful Hope tokens or 
generating terrifying Fear tokens for the GM.THE GOLDEN RULE 
The most important rule of Daggerheart is to make the game 
your own. The rules included in this SRD are designed to 
help you enjoy the experience at the table, but everyone has 
a different approach to interpreting rules and telling stories. 
The rules should never get in the way of the story you want 
to tell, the characters you want to play, or the adventures you 
want to have. As long as your group agrees, everything can 
be adjusted to fit your play style. If thereâs a rule youâd rather 
ignore or modify, feel free to implement any change with your 
tableâs consent.
RULINGS OVER RULES
While playing Daggerheart, the GM and players should always 
prioritize rulings over rules. This SRD offers answers for many 
questions your table may have about the game, but it wonât 
answer all of them. When youâre in doubt about how a rule 
applies, the GM should make a ruling that aligns with the 
narrative.
For example, Daggerheart has a weapon called a grappler that 
lets you pull a target close to you. If you try to use it to pull an 
entire castle, the weapon text doesnât forbid you from doing 
thatâbut it doesnât make sense within the narrative. Instead, 
the GM might rule that you pull a few bricks out, or pull 
yourself toward the wall instead.
Similarly, if your character does something that would logically 
result in immediate deathâsuch as diving into an active 
volcano without protectionâyou might not get to make 
one of Daggerheartâs death moves, which normally give you 
control of your characterâs fate in their final moments. This 
kind of consequence should be made clear before the action is 
completed, and it should always follow the logic of the world. 
As a narrative-focused game, Daggerheart is not a place 
where technical, out-of-context interpretations of the rules are 
encouraged. Everything should flow back to the fiction, and 
the GM has the authority and responsibility to make rulings 
about how rules are applied to underscore that fiction.

CHARACTER CREATION
Unless their table chooses to use pre-generated characters, 
each player creates their own PC by making a series of 
guided choices. Some of these decisions are purely narrative, 
meaning they only appear in or affect the game through 
roleplaying, but others are mechanical choices that affect the 
things their PC is able to do and which actions theyâre more 
(or less) likely to succeed at when making moves and taking 
action.
Note: You can fill in your characterâs name, pronouns, and 
Character Description details at any point of the character 
creation process.
STEP 1
Choose a Class and Subclass.  
Classes are role-based archetypes that determine which class 
features and domain cards a PC gains access to throughout 
the campaign. There are nine classes in this SRD: Bard, Druid, 
Guardian, Ranger, Rogue, Seraph, Sorcerer, Warrior, Wizard.
â¢ Select a class and take its corresponding character sheet 
and character guide printouts. These sheets are for 
recording your PCâs details; youâll update and reference 
them throughout the campaign.
â¢ Every class begins with one or more unique class 
feature(s), described at the bottom left of each classâs 
character sheet. If your class feature prompts you to make 
a selection, do so now.
â¢ Choose a Subclass 
Subclasses further refine a class archetype and reinforce 
its expression by granting access to unique subclass 
features. Each class comprises two subclasses. Select one 
of your classâs subclasses and take its Foundation card. 
STEP 2
Choose Your Heritage.  
Your characterâs heritage combines two elements: ancestry 
and community. 
â¢ A characterâs ancestry represents their species or lineage; 
it grants them certain physical traits and two unique 
ancestry features. Take the card for one of the following 
ancestries, then write its name in the Heritage field of your 
character sheet: Clank, Drakona, Dwarf, Elf, Faerie, Faun, 
Firbolg, Fungril, Galapa, Giant, Goblin, Halfling, Human, 
Infernis, Katari, Orc, Ribbet, Simiah. T o create a Mixed 
Ancestry, take the top (first-listed) ancestry feature from 
one ancestry and the bottom (second-listed) ancestry 
feature from another.
â¢ Your characterâs community represents their culture 
or environment of origin and grants them a community 
feature. Take the card for one of the following 
communities, then write its name in the Heritage field of 
your character sheet: Highborne, Loreborne, Orderborne, 
Ridgeborne, Seaborne, Slyborne, Underborne, 
Wanderborne, Wildborne.STEP 3
Assign Character Traits.  
Your character has six traits that represent their physical, 
mental, and social aptitude:
â¢ Agility (Use it to Sprint, Leap, Maneuver,etc.) 
A high Agility means youâre fast on your feet, nimble on 
difficult terrain, and quick to react to danger. Youâll make 
an Agility Roll to scurry up a rope, sprint to cover, or 
bound from rooftop to rooftop.
â¢ Strength (Use it to Lift, Smash, Grapple, etc.) 
A high Strength means youâre better at feats that test your 
physical prowess and stamina. Youâll make a Strength Roll 
to break through a door, lift heavy objects, or hold your 
ground against a charging foe.
â¢ Finesse (Use it to Control, Hide, Tinker, etc.)  
A high Finesse means youâre skilled at tasks that require 
accuracy, stealth, or the utmost control. Youâll make a 
Finesse Roll to use fine tools, escape notice, or strike with 
precision.
â¢ Instinct (Use it to Perceive, Sense, Navigate, etc.)  
A high Instinct means you have a keen sense of your 
surroundings and a natural intuition. Youâll make an 
Instinct Roll to sense danger, notice details in the world 
around you, or track an elusive foe.
â¢ Presence (Use it to Charm, Perform, Deceive, etc.)  
A high Presence means you have a strong force of 
personality and a facility for social situations. Youâll make 
a Presence Roll to plead your case, intimidate a foe, or 
capture the attention of a crowd.
â¢ Knowledge (Use it to Recall, Analyze, Comprehend, etc.) 
A high Knowledge means you know information others 
donât and understand how to apply your mind through 
deduction and inference. Youâll make a Knowledge Roll 
to interpret facts, see the patterns clearly, or remember 
important information.
When you âroll with a trait,â that traitâs modifier is added to 
the rollâs total. Assign the modifiers +2, +1, +1, +0, +0, -1 to 
your characterâs traits in any order you wish.
STEP 4
Record Additional Character Information. 
â¢ Characters start a new campaign at Level 1. Record your 
level in the designated space at the top of your character 
sheet.
â¢ Evasion represents your characterâs ability to avoid 
damage. Your characterâs starting Evasion is determined 
by their class and appears directly beneath the Evasion 
field on your character sheet; copy this number into the 
Evasion field.
â¢ Hit Points (HP) are an abstract measure of your physical 
health. Your starting HP is determined by your class and is 
recorded on your character sheet.
4
Daggerheart SRD

â¢ Stress reflects your ability to withstand the mental and 
emotional strain of dangerous situations and physical 
exertion. Every PC starts with 6 Stress slots.
â¢ Hope is a metacurrency that fuels special moves and 
certain abilities or features. All PCs start with 2 Hope; 
mark these in the Hope field of your character sheet.
STEP 5
Choose Your Starting Equipment
Choose your weapon(s):
â¢ Select from the Tier 1 Weapon Tables. Either a two-
handed primary weapon or a one-handed primary 
weapon and a one-handed secondary weapon.Then equip 
your selection by recording it in the Active Weapon field of 
your character sheet.
â¢ At Level 1, your Proficiency is 1; write this number in the 
Proficiency field on your character sheet, then calculate 
and record your damage roll by combining your Proficiency 
value with your equipped weapon(s) damage dice. 
Example: If your Proficiency is 1 and your weaponâs damage 
dice is d6+1, your damage roll is 1d6+1. Proficiency only 
determines how many damage dice you roll, and does not 
affect any flat damage modifiers.
Choose and equip one set of armor from the Tier 1 Armor 
Table, then record its details in the Active Armor field of your 
character sheet. 
â¢ Add your characterâs level to your equipped armorâs Base 
Thresholds and record the total for both numbers in the 
corresponding fields. At character creation, your level is 1.
â¢ Record your Armor Score in the field at the top left of 
your character sheet. Your Armor Score is equal to your 
equipped armorâs Base Score plus any permanent bonuses 
your character has to their Armor Score from other 
abilities, features, or effects.
Add the following items to the Inventory fields on your 
character sheet:
â¢ A torch, 50 feet of rope, basic supplies, and a handful 
of gold (mark one box in the left-hand column of your 
character sheet titled âGold > Handfulsâ)
â¢ EITHER a Minor Health Potion (clear 1d4 Hit Points) OR a 
Minor Stamina Potion (clear 1d4 Stress)
â¢ One of the class-specific items listed on your character 
guide
â¢ If applicable, whichever class-specific item you selected to 
carry your spells
â¢ Any other GM-approved items youâd like to have at the 
start of the gameSTEP 6
Create Your Background.  
Develop your characterâs background by answering the 
background questions in your character guide, modifying or 
replacing them if they donât fit the character you want to play. 
Note: Your background has no explicit mechanical effect, 
but it greatly affects the character youâll play and the prep 
the GM will do. Throughout character creation, you can 
adjust choices you made in earlier steps to better reflect this 
background as your character takes shape. If you wish, you 
can leave your characterâs past more ambiguous for the time 
being and discover their backstory through play.
STEP 7
Create Your Experiences.  
An Experience is a word or phrase used to encapsulate a 
specific set of skills, personality traits, or aptitudes your 
character has acquired over the course of their life. When your 
PC makes a move, they can spend a Hope to add a relevant 
Experienceâs modifier to the action roll.
â¢ Your PC gets two Experiences at character creation, each 
with a +2 modifier.
â¢ Thereâs no set list of Experiences to choose from, but an 
Experience canât be too broadly applicable and it canât 
grant your character specific mechanical benefits, such as 
magic spells or special abilities. For example, âLuckyâ and 
âHighly Skilledâ are too broad, because they could be applied 
to virtually any roll. Likewise, âSupersonic Flightâ and 
âInvulnerableâ imply game-breaking special abilities.
EXAMPLE EXPERIENCES
Backgrounds: Assassin, Blacksmith, Bodyguard, Bounty

STEP 8
Choose Domain Cards.  
Your class has access to two of the nine Domains included in 
the core set. Choose two cards from your classâs domains, 
which are listed in the upper left of your character sheet. You 
can take one card from each domain or two from a single 
domain, whichever you prefer. 
STEP 9
Create Your Connections.  
Connections are the relationships between the PCs. T o create 
connections, follow these steps:
â¢ Go around the table and have each player describe their 
characters to one anotherâat a minimum, their name, 
pronouns, character description, experiences, and the 
answers to their background questions. 
â¢ Discuss potential connections between the PCs using the 
questions included in the âConnectionsâ section of your 
character guide as inspiration.
â¢ Suggest at least one connection between your character 
and each other playerâs PC. Accept any suggested 
connections you want to explore, reject any you donât.
Note: A player can reject a suggested connection for any 
reason, and itâs okay if there isnât an established connection 
between every pair of PCsâyou can always discover and 
develop those relationships through play.

Daggerheart SRD

CORE MATERIALS
DOMAINS
The Daggerheart core set includes 9 Domain Decks, each 
comprising a collection of cards granting features or special 
abilities expressing a particular theme. 
The 9 Domains are:
ARCANA
Arcana is the domain of innate and instinctual magic. Those 
who choose this path tap into the raw, enigmatic forces of the 
realms to manipulate both their own energy and the elements. 
Arcana offers wielders a volatile power, but it is incredibly 
potent when correctly channeled. The Arcana domain can be 
accessed by the Druid and Sorcerer classes.
BLADE
Blade is the domain of weapon mastery. Whether by steel, 
bow, or perhaps a more specialized arm, those who follow this 
path have the skill to cut short the lives of others. Wielders of 
Blade dedicate themselves to achieving inexorable power over 
death. The Blade domain can be accessed by the Guardian 
and Warrior classes.
BONE
Bone is the domain of tactics and the body. Practitioners 
of this domain have an uncanny control over their own 
physical abilities and an eye for predicting the behaviors of 
others in combat. Adherents to Bone gain an unparalleled 
understanding of bodies and their movements. The Bone 
domain can be accessed by the Ranger & Warrior classes.
CODEX
Codex is the domain of intensive magical study. Those who 
seek magical knowledge turn to the equations of power 
recorded in books, written on scrolls, etched into walls, or 
tattooed on bodies. Codex offers a commanding and versatile 
understanding of magic to devotees who pursue knowledge 
beyond the boundaries of common wisdom. The Codex 
domain can be accessed by the Bard  and Wizard classes.
GRACE
Grace is the domain of charisma. Through rapturous 
storytelling, charming spells, or a shroud of lies, those who 
channel this power define the realities of their adversaries, 
bending perception to their will. Grace offers its wielders raw 
magnetism and mastery over language. The Grace domain can 
be accessed by the Bard  and Rogue classesMIDNIGHT
Midnight is the domain of shadows and secrecy. Whether 
by clever tricks, deft magic, or the cloak of night, those who 
channel these forces practice the art of obscurity and can 
uncover sequestered treasures. Midnight offers practitioners 
the power to control and create enigmas. The Midnight 
domain can be access by the Rogue and Sorcerer classes.
SAGE
Sage is the domain of the natural world. Those who walk 
this path tap into the unfettered power of the earth and its 
creatures to unleash raw magic. Sage grants its adherents 
the vitality of a blooming flower and the ferocity of a ravenous 
predator. The Sage domain can be accessed by the Druid and 
Ranger classes.
SPLENDOR
Splendor is the domain of life. Through this magic, followers 
gain the ability to heal and, to an extent, control death. 
Splendor offers its disciples the magnificent ability to both 
give and end life. The Splendor domain can be accessed by the 
Seraph and Wizard classes.
VALOR
Valor is the domain of protection. Whether through attack or 
defense, those who choose this discipline channel formidable 
strength to protect their allies in battle. Valor offers great 
power to those who raise their shields in defense of others. 
The Valor domain can be accessed by the Guardian and 
Seraph classes.
Class Domains
Each class grants access to two domains:
â¢ Bard: Codex & Grace
â¢ Druid: Arcana & Sage
â¢ Guardian: Blade & Valor
â¢ Ranger: Bone & Sage
â¢ Rogue: Grace & Midnight
â¢ Seraph: Splendor & Valor
â¢ Sorcerer: Arcana & Midnight
â¢ Warrior: Blade & Bone
â¢ Wizard: Codex & Splendor
PCs acquire two 1st-level domain cards at character creation 
and an additional domain card at or below their level each time 
they level up.
7
Daggerheart SRD

DOMAIN CARDS
Each domain card provides one or more features your PC 
can utilize during their adventures. Some domain cards 
provide moves you can make, such as a unique attack or a 
spell. Others offer passive effects, new downtime or social 
encounter abilities, or one-time benefits.
DOMAIN CARD ANATOMY
Each domain card includes six elements:
Level
The number in the top left of the card indicates the cardâs 
level. You cannot acquire a domain card with a level higher 
than your PCâs.
Domain
Beneath the cardâs level there is a symbol indicating its 
domain. You can only choose cards from your classâs two 
domains. 
Recall Cost
The number and lightning bolt in the top right of the card 
shows its Recall Cost. This is the amount of Stress a player 
must mark to swap this card from their vault with a card 
from their loadout.
Note: A player can swap domain cards during downtime 
without paying the domain cardâs Recall Cost.  
Title
The name of the card.
Type
The cardâs type is listed in the center above the title. There 
are three types of domain cards: abilities, spells, and 
grimoires. Abilities are typically non-magical in nature, 
while spells are magical. Grimoires are unique to the Codex 
domain and grant access to a collection of less potent 
spells. Some game mechanics only apply to certain types 
of cards.
Feature
The text on the bottom half of the card describes its 
feature(s), including any special rules you need to follow 
when you use that card.
LOADOUT & VAULT
Your loadout is the set of acquired domain cards whose 
effects your PC can use during play. You can have up to 
5 domain cards in your loadout at one time. Once youâve 
acquired six or more domain cards, you must choose five to 
keep in your loadout; the rest are considered to be in your 
vault. Vault cards are inactive and do not influence play
Note: Your subclass, ancestry, and community cards donât 
count toward your loadout or vault and are always active and 
available.
At the start of a rest, before using downtime moves, you can 
freely move cards between your loadout and your vault, so 
long as your loadout doesnât exceed its five-card maximum.
T o move a card from your vault to your loadout at any other 
time, you must mark a number of Stress equal to the vaulted cardâs Recall Cost (located in the top right of the card next to 
the lightning bolt symbol). If your loadout is already full, you 
must also move a card from your loadout to your vault to make 
space, though you can do this at no cost.
When you gain a new domain card at level-up, you can 
immediately move it into your loadout for free. If your loadout 
is already full, you must also move a card from your loadout to 
your vault to make space.
USAGE LIMITS
If a domain card restricts how often it can be used, you can 
track such limits with whatever method you prefer, such 
as turning the card sideways, flipping it facedown, or using 
tokens. 
Note: if an effect or ability gives you a number of uses equal 
to a trait with a modifier of +0 or less, it grants you 0 uses.
CLASSES
A class is a role-based archetype that determines a PCâs:
â¢ Access to Domains: Each class grants access to two 
domains; players choose cards from these domains during 
character creation and when leveling up.
â¢ Starting Evasion and Hit Points (HP)
â¢ Starting Items
â¢ Class Feature(s)
â¢ Class Hope Feature, a class feature that costs 3 Hope to 
activate.
There are 9 classes in the Daggerheart core materials: Bard, 
Druid, Guardian, Ranger, Rogue, Seraph, Sorcerer, Warrior, 
and Wizard.
SUBCLASSES
Each class is divided into two subclasses, each of which 
further defines and highlights one aspect of its class 
archetype. Your chosen subclass grants the following: 
â¢ Spellcast Trait: the trait used on all Spellcast rolls.
â¢ Foundation Feature: a unique starting feature that 
establishes the identity and strengths of the subclass.
â¢ Specialization Feature: an advanced feature that can be 
gained on level up. For some subclasses, the specialization 
feature grants a new ability; for others, it expands or 
enhances a feature you already acquired through a class or 
subclass.
â¢ Mastery Feature: The mastery feature is a subclassâs most 
powerful feature, which can be gained at higher levels. 
For some subclasses, the mastery feature unlocks an 
extraordinary new ability; for others, itâs the impressive 
culmination of their subclassâs core feature.
The Daggerheart core set includes cards detailing each 
foundation, specialization, and mastery feature. When you 
acquire one of these features, take its card for use as a 
reference during play.

BARD
Bards are the most charismatic people in all the realms. 
Members of this class are masters of captivation and 
specialize in a variety of performance types, including singing, 
playing musical instruments, weaving tales, or telling jokes. 
Whether performing for an audience or speaking to an 
individual, bards thrive in social situations. Members of this 
profession bond and train at schools or guilds, but a current 
of egotism runs through those of the bardic persuasion. While 
they may be the most likely class to bring people together, a 
bard of ill temper can just as easily tear a party apart.

BACKGROUND QUESTIONS
Answer any of the following background questions. You can 
also create your own questions.
â¢ Who from your community taught you to have such 
confidence in yourself?
â¢ You were in love once. Who did you adore, and how 
did they hurt you?
â¢ Youâve always looked up to another bard. Who are 
they, and why do you idolize them?
CONNECTIONS
Ask your fellow players one of the following questions for 
their character to answer, or create your own questions.
â¢ What made you realize we were going to be such 
good friends?
â¢ What do I do that annoys you?
â¢ Why do you grab my hand at night?DRUID
Becoming a druid is more than an occupation; itâs a calling for 
those who wish to learn from and protect the magic of the 
wilderness. While one might underestimate a gentle druid who 
practices the often-quiet work of cultivating flora, druids who 
channel the untamed forces of nature are terrifying to behold. 
Druids cultivate their abilities in small groups, often connected 
by a specific ethos or locale, but some choose to work alone. 
Through years of study and dedication, druids can learn to 
transform into beasts and shape nature itself.
DOMAINS - Sage & Arcana
STARTING EVASION - 10
STARTING HIT POINTS - 6
CLASS ITEMS - A small bag of rocks and bones or a 
strange pendant found in the dirt
DRUIDâS HOPE FEATURE
Evolution: Spend 3 Hope to transform into a Beastform 
without marking a Stress. When you do, choose one trait to 
raise by +1 until you drop out of that Beastform.
CLASS FEATURES
Beastform: Mark a Stress to magically transform into a 
creature of your tier or lower from the Beastform list. You 
can drop out of this form at any time. While transformed, 
you canât use weapons or cast spells from domain cards, 
but you can still use other features or abilities you have 
access to. Spells you cast before you transform stay 
active and last for their normal duration, and you can talk 
and communicate as normal. Additionally, you gain the 
Beastformâs features, add their Evasion bonus to your 
Evasion, and use the trait specified in their statistics for 
your attack. While youâre in a Beastform, your armor 
becomes part of your body and you mark Armor Slots as 
usual; when you drop out of a Beastform, those marked 
Armor Slots remain marked. If you mark your last Hit Point, 
you automatically drop out of this form.
Wildtouch: You can perform harmless, subtle effects that 
involve natureâsuch as causing a flower to rapidly grow, 
summoning a slight gust of wind, or starting a campfireâ
at will.

â¢ What did you confide in me that makes me leap into 
danger for you every time?
â¢ What animal do I say you remind me of?
â¢ What affectionate nickname have you given me?

Daggerheart SRD

BEASTFORM OPTIONS
When you use your âBeastformâ feature, choose a creature 
category of your tier or lower. At the GMâs discretion, you can 
describe yourself transforming into any animal that reasonably 
fits into that category.
Beastform categories are divided by tier. Each entry includes 
the following details:
â¢ Creature Category: Each categoryâs name describes the 
common role or behavior of creatures in that category 
(such as Agile Scout). This name is followed by a few 
examples of animals that fit in that category (in this 
example, fox, mouse, and weasel).
â¢ Character Trait: While transformed, you gain a bonus to 
the listed trait. For example, while transformed into an 
Agile Scout, you gain a +1 bonus to your Agility. When this 
form drops, you lose this bonus.
â¢ Attack Rolls: When you make an attack while transformed, 
you use the creatureâs listed range, trait, and damage dice, 
but you use your Proficiency. For example, as an Agile 
Scout, you can attack a target within Melee range using 
your Agility. On a success, you deal d4 physical damage 
using your Proficiency.
â¢ Evasion: While transformed, you add the creatureâs 
Evasion bonus to your normal Evasion. For example, if your 
Evasion is usually 8 and your Beastform says âEvasion +2,â 
your Evasion becomes 10 while youâre in that form.
â¢ Advantages: Your form makes you especially suited to 
certain actions. When you make an action or reaction 
roll related to one of the verbs listed for that creature 
category, you gain advantage on that roll. For example, 
an Agile Scout gains advantage on rolls made to sneak 
around, search for objects or creatures, and related 
activities.
â¢ Features: Each form includes unique features. For 
example, an Agile Scout excels at silent, dexterous 
movementâbut theyâre also fragile, making you more 
likely to drop out of Beastform.
TIER 1
AGILE SCOUT 
(Fox, Mouse, Weasel, etc.)
Agility +1 | Evasion +2 
Melee Agility d4 phy
Gain advantage on: deceive, locate, sneak

The title of guardian represents an array of martial 
professions, speaking more to their moral compass and 
unshakeable fortitude than the means by which they fight. 
While many guardians join groups of militants for either a 
country or cause, theyâre more likely to follow those few they 
truly care for, majority be damned. Guardians are known for 
fighting with remarkable ferocity even against overwhelming 
odds, defending their cohort above all else. Woe betide those 
who harm the ally of a guardian, as the guardian will answer 
this injury in kind.

Unstoppable. You gain an Unstoppable Die. At level 1, your 
Unstoppable Die is a d4. Place it on your character sheet 
in the space provided, starting with the 1 value facing up. 
After you make a damage roll that deals 1 or more Hit 
Points to a target, increase the Unstoppable Die value by 
one. When the dieâs value would exceed its maximum value 
or when the scene ends, remove the die and drop out of 
Unstoppable. At level 5, your Unstoppable Die increases to 
a d6.
While Unstoppable, you gain the following benefits:
â¢ You reduce the severity of physical damage by one 
threshold (Severe to Major, Major to Minor, Minor to 
None).
â¢ You add the current value of the Unstoppable Die to 
your damage roll.
â¢ You canât be Restrained or Vulnerable.
Tip: If your Unstoppable Die is a d4 and the 4 is 
currently facing up, you remove the die the next time 
you would increase it. However, if your Unstoppable Die 
has increased to a d6 and the 4 is currently facing up, 
youâll turn it to 5 the next time you would increase it. In 
this case, youâll remove the die after you would need to 
increase it higher than 6.

RANGER
Rangers are highly skilled hunters who, despite their martial 
abilities, rarely lend their skills to an army. Through mastery of 
the body and a deep understanding of the wilderness, rangers 
become sly tacticians, pursuing their quarry with cunning and 
patience. Many rangers track and fight alongside an animal 
companion with whom theyâve forged a powerful spiritual 
bond. By honing their skills in the wild, rangers become expert 
trackers, as likely to ensnare their foes in a trap as they are to 
assail them head-on.

RANGER COMPANION
When you choose the Beastbound Ranger subclass, take 
a companion sheet. This sheet is for tracking important 
information about your characterâs companion and can be 
tucked beneath the right side of your character sheet for ease 
of viewing.
STEP 1: NAME YOUR COMPANION
Work with the GM to decide what kind of animal you have 
as your companion. Give them a name and add a picture of 
them to the companion sheet.  
STEP 2: WRITE THEIR EVASION
Fill in their Evasion, which starts at 10.  
STEP 3: CHOOSE THEIR COMPANION EXPERIENCE
Create two Experiences for your companion based on their 
training and the history you have together. 
Start with +2 in both Experiences. Whenever you gain a 
new Experience, your companion also gains one. All new 
Experiences start at +2.
Example Companion Experiences
Bold Distraction, Expert Climber, Fetch, Friendly, Guardian 
of the Forest, Horrifying, Intimidating, Loyal Until the 
End, Navigation, Nimble, Nobody Left Behind, On High 
Alert, Protective, Royal Companion, Scout, Service Animal, 
Trusted Mount, Vigilant, We Always Find Them, You Canât 
Hit What You Canât Find

DAMAGE DIE
Finally, describe your companionâs method of dealing 
damage (their standard attack) and record it in the âAttack 
& Damageâ section. At level 1, your companionâs damage 
die is a d6 and their range is Melee.

working with your companion.
USING SPELLCAST ROLLS, HOPE, AND EXPERIENCES

command them to take action. Spend a Hope to add an 
applicable Companion Experience to the roll. On a success 
with Hope, if your next action builds on their success, you gain 
advantage on the roll.
ATTACKING WITH YOUR COMPANION
When you command your companion to attack, they gain any 
benefits that would normally only apply to you (such as the 
effects of âRangerâs Focusâ). On a success, their damage roll 
uses your Proficiency and their damage die.TAKING DAMAGE AS STRESS
â¢ When your companion would take any amount of damage, 
they mark a Stress. When they mark their last Stress, 
they drop out of the scene (by hiding, fleeing, or a similar 
action). They remain unavailable until the start of your next 
long rest, where they return with 1 Stress cleared.
â¢ When you choose a downtime move that clears Stress 
on yourself, your companion clears an equal number of 
Stress.
LEVELING UP YOUR 
COMPANION
When your character levels up, choose one available option 
for your companion from the following list and mark it on your 
sheet:
â¢ Intelligent: Your companion gains a permanent +1 bonus 
to a Companion Experience of your choice.
â¢ Light in the Dark: Use this as an additional Hope slot your 
character can mark.
â¢ Creature Comfort: Once per rest, when you take time 
during a quiet moment to give your companion love and 
attention, you can gain a Hope or you can both clear a 
Stress.
â¢ Armored: When your companion takes damage, you can 
mark one of your Armor Slots instead of marking one of 
their Stress.
â¢ Vicious: Increase your companionâs damage dice or range 
by one step (d6 to d8, Close to Far, etc.).
â¢ Resilient: Your companion gains an additional Stress slot.
â¢ Bonded: When you mark your last Hit Point, your 
companion rushes to your side to comfort you. Roll a 
number of d6s equal to the unmarked Stress slots they 
have and mark them. If any roll a 6, your companion helps 
you up. Clear your last Hit Point and return to the scene.
â¢ Aware: Your companion gains a permanent +2 bonus to 
their Evasion.

windows, or dealing underhanded blows. These masters of 
magical craft manipulate shadow and movement, adding an 
array of useful and deadly tools to their repertoire. Rogues 
frequently establish guilds to meet future accomplices, hire 
out jobs, and hone secret skills, proving that thereâs honor 
among thieves for those who know where to look.

SERAPH
Seraphs are divine fighters and healers imbued with sacred 
purpose. A wide array of deities exist within the realms, and 
thus numerous kinds of seraphs are appointed by these gods. 
Their ethos traditionally aligns with the domain or goals of 
their god, such as defending the weak, exacting vengeance, 
protecting a land or artifact, or upholding a particular faith. 
Some seraphs ally themselves with an army or locale, much 
to the satisfaction of their rulers, but other crusaders fight in 
opposition to the follies of the Mortal Realm. It is better to be 
a seraphâs ally than their enemy, as they are terrifying foes to 
those who defy their purpose.

SORCERER
Not all innate magic users choose to hone their craft, but 
those who do can become powerful sorcerers. The gifts of 
these wielders are passed down through families, even if the 
family is unaware of or reluctant to practice them. A sorcererâs 
abilities can range from the elemental to the illusionary and 
beyond, and many practitioners band together into collectives 
based on their talents. The act of becoming a formidable 
sorcerer is not the practice of acquiring power, but learning 
to cultivate and control the power one already possesses. The 
magic of a misguided or undisciplined sorcerer is a dangerous 
force indeed.

Becoming a warrior requires years, often a lifetime, of training 
and dedication to the mastery of weapons and violence. While 
many who seek to fight hone only their strength, warriors 
understand the importance of an agile body and mind, 
making them some of the most sought-after fighters across 
the realms. Frequently, warriors find employment within an 
army, a band of mercenaries, or even a royal guard, but their 
potential is wasted in any position where they cannot continue 
to improve and expand their skills. Warriors are known to have 
a favored weapon; to come between them and their blade 
would be a grievous mistake.

WIZARD
Whether through an institution or individual study, those 
known as wizards acquire and hone immense magical power 
over years of learning using a variety of tools, including books, 
stones, potions, and herbs. Some wizards dedicate their lives 
to mastering a particular school of magic, while others learn 
from a wide variety of disciplines. Many wizards become 
wise and powerful figures in their communities, advising 
rulers, providing medicines and healing, and even leading war 
councils. While these mages all work toward the common goal 
of collecting magical knowledge, wizards often have the most 
conflict within their own ranks, as the acquisition, keeping, 
and sharing of powerful secrets is a topic of intense debate 
that has resulted in innumerable deaths.

ANCESTRIES
Ancestries represent your characterâs lineage, which affects 
their physical appearance and access to certain special 
abilities. The following section describes each ancestry in 
Daggerheart and the characteristics generally shared by 
members of that ancestry, however, each player decides how 
much their character aligns with the âstandardâ or âaverageâ 
expression of their ancestry.
In Daggerheart, the term âpeopleâ is used to refer to all 
ancestries, as individuals from all lineages possess unique 
characteristics and cultures, as well as personhood. 
Some ancestries are described using the term âhumanoid.â 
This does not imply any genetic relation to âhumans,â which 
is a distinct ancestry within Daggerheart. Instead, it refers 
to the set of physical characteristics humans will recognize 
from their own anatomy, such as bipedal movement, upright 
posture, facial layout, and more. These traits vary by ancestry 
and individual, though âhumanoidâ should still provide a useful 
frame of reference.
The core ruleset includes the following ancestries: Clank, 
Drakona, Dwarf, Elf, Faerie, Faun, Firbolg, Fungril, Galapa, 
Giant, Goblin, Halfling, Human, Infernis, Katari, Orc, Ribbet, 
Simiah, and Mixed Ancestry.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Each ancestry grants two ancestry features. While some 
features (such as the ability to fly) are implicitly tied to an 
ancestryâs anatomy, players determine their charactersâ 
physical form. Work with the GM to re-flavor any implied traits 
that donât align with your character concept.
If youâd like to make a character who combines more than one 
ancestry, see âMixed Ancestry.â
CLANK
Clanks are sentient mechanical beings built from a variety 
of materials, including metal, wood, and stone. They can 
resemble humanoids, animals, or even inanimate objects. Like 
organic beings, their bodies come in a wide array of sizes. 
Because of their bespoke construction, many clanks have 
highly specialized physical configurations. Examples include 
clawed hands for grasping, wheels for movement, or built-in 
weaponry. 
Many clanks embrace body modifications for style as well as 
function, and members of other ancestries often turn to clank 
artisans to construct customized mobility aids and physical 
adornments. Other ancestries can create clanks, even using 
their own physical characteristics as inspiration, but itâs also 
common for clanks to build one another. A clankâs lifespan 
extends as long as theyâre able to acquire or craft new parts, 
making their physical form effectively immortal. That said, 
their minds are subject to the effects of time, and deteriorate 
as the magic that powers them loses potency.ANCESTRY FEATURES
Purposeful Design: Decide who made you and for what 
purpose. At character creation, choose one of your 
Experiences that best aligns with this purpose and gain a 
permanent +1 bonus to it.
Efficient: When you take a short rest, you can choose a long 
rest move instead of a short rest move.
DRAKONA
Drakona resemble wingless dragons in humanoid form 
and possess a powerful elemental breath. All drakona have 
thick scales that provide excellent natural armor against 
both attacks and the forces of nature. They are large in size, 
ranging from 5 feet to 7 feet on average, with long sharp 
teeth. New teeth grow throughout a Drakonaâs approximately 
350-year lifespan, so they are never in danger of permanently 
losing an incisor. Unlike their dragon ancestors, drakona donât 
have wings and canât fly without magical aid. Members of 
this ancestry pass down the element of their breath through 
generations, though in rare cases, a drakonaâs elemental 
power will differ from the rest of their familyâs. 
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Scales: Your scales act as natural protection. When you would 
take Severe damage, you can mark a Stress to mark 1 fewer 
Hit Points. 
Elemental Breath: Choose an element for your breath (such 
as electricity, fire, or ice). You can use this breath against a 
target or group of targets within Very Close range, treating it 
as an Instinct weapon that deals d8 magic damage using your 
Proficiency.
DWARF
Dwarves are most easily recognized as short humanoids 
with square frames, dense musculature, and thick hair. 
Their average height ranges from 4 to 5 Â½ feet, and they 
are often broad in proportion to their stature. Their skin and 
nails contain a high amount of keratin, making them naturally 
resilient. This allows dwarves to embed gemstones into their 
bodies and decorate themselves with tattoos or piercings. 
Their hair grows thicklyâusually on their heads, but some 
dwarves have thick hair across their bodies as well. Dwarves 
of all genders can grow facial hair, which they often style in 
elaborate arrangements. Typically, dwarves live up to 250 
years of age, maintaining their muscle mass well into later life.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Thick Skin: When you take Minor damage, you can mark 2 
Stress instead of marking a Hit Point.
Increased Fortitude: Spend 3 Hope to halve incoming physical 
damage. 
27
Daggerheart SRD

ELF
Elves are typically tall humanoids with pointed ears and 
acutely attuned senses. Their ears vary in size and pointed 
shape, and as they age, the tips begin to droop. While elves 
come in a wide range of body types, they are all fairly tall, with 
heights ranging from about 6 to 6 Â½ feet. All elves have the 
ability to drop into a celestial trance, rather than sleep. This 
allows them to rest effectively in a short amount of time.
Some elves possess what is known as a âmystic form,â which 
occurs when an elf has dedicated themself to the study or 
protection of the natural world so deeply that their physical 
form changes. These characteristics can include celestial 
freckles, the presence of leaves, vines, or flowers in their 
hair, eyes that flicker like fire, and more. Sometimes these 
traits are inherited from parents, but if an elf changes their 
environment or magical focus, their appearance changes over 
time. Because elves live for about 350 years, these traits can 
shift more than once throughout their lifespan.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Quick Reactions: Mark a Stress to gain advantage on a 
reaction roll.
Celestial Trance: During a rest, you can drop into a trance to 
choose an additional downtime move.
FAERIE
Faeries are winged humanoid creatures with insectile features. 
These characteristics cover a broad spectrum from humanoid 
to insectoidâsome possess additional arms, compound eyes, 
lantern organs, chitinous exoskeletons, or stingers. Because 
of their close ties to the natural world, they also frequently 
possess attributes that allow them to blend in with various 
plants. The average height of a faerie ranges from about 
2 feet to 5 feet, but some faeries grow up to 7 feet tall. All 
faeries possess membranous wings and they each go through 
a process of metamorphosis. The process and changes differ 
from faerie to faerie, but during this transformation each 
individual manifests the unique appearance they will carry 
throughout the rest of their approximately 50-year lifespan.  
ANCESTRY FEATURE
Luckbender: Once per session, after you or a willing ally within 
Close range makes an action roll, you can spend 3 Hope to 
reroll the Duality Dice.
Wings: You can fly. While flying, you can mark a Stress after 
an adversary makes an attack against you to gain a +2 bonus 
to your Evasion against that attack.
FAUN
Fauns resemble humanoid goats with curving horns, square 
pupils, and cloven hooves. Though their appearances may 
vary, most fauns have a humanoid torso and a goatlike lower 
body covered in dense fur. Faun faces can be more caprine or more humanlike, and they have a wide variety of ear and horn 
shapes. Faun horns range from short with minimal curvature 
to much larger with a distinct curl. The average faun ranges 
from 4 feet to 6 Â½ feet tall, but their height can change 
dramatically from one moment to the next based on their 
stance. The majority of fauns have proportionately long limbs, 
no matter their size or shape, and are known for their ability 
to deliver powerful blows with their split hooves. Fauns live 
for roughly 225 years, and as they age, their appearance can 
become increasingly goatlike.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Caprine Leap: You can leap anywhere within Close range as 
though you were using normal movement, allowing you to 
vault obstacles, jump across gaps, or scale barriers with ease.
Kick: When you succeed on an attack against a target within 
Melee range, you can mark a Stress to kick yourself off 
them, dealing an extra 2d6 damage and knocking back either 
yourself or the target to Very Close range.
FIRBOLG
Firbolgs are bovine humanoids typically recognized by their 
broad noses and long, drooping ears. Some have faces that 
are a blend of humanoid and bison, ox, cow, or other bovine 
creatures. Others, often referred to as minotaurs, have heads 
that entirely resemble cattle. They are tall and muscular 
creatures, with heights ranging from around 5 feet to
7 feet, and possess remarkable strength no matter their age. 
Some firbolgs are known to use this strength to charge their 
adversaries, an action that is particuarly effective for those 
who have one of the many varieties of horn styles commonly 
found in this ancestry. Though their unique characteristics can 
vary, all firbolgs are covered in fur, which can be muted and 
earth-toned in color, or come in a variety of pastels, such as 
soft pinks and blues. On average, firbolgs live for about 150 
years.  
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Charge: When you succeed on an Agility Roll to move from Far 
or Very Far range into Melee range with one or more targets, 
you can mark a Stress to deal 1d12 physical damage to all 
targets within Melee range.
Unshakable: When you would mark a Stress, roll a d6. On a 
result of 6, donât mark it.
28
Daggerheart SRD

FUNGRIL
Fungril resemble humanoid mushrooms. They can be 
either more humanoid or more fungal in appearance, and 
they come in an assortment of colors, from earth tones to 
bright reds, yellows, purples, and blues. Fungril display an 
incredible variety of bodies, faces, and limbs, as thereâs no 
single common shape among them. Even their heights range 
from a tiny 2 feet tall to a staggering 7 feet tall. While the 
common lifespan of a fungril is about 300 years, some have 
been reported to live much longer. They can communicate 
nonverbally, and many members of this ancestry use a 
mycelial array to chemically exchange information with other 
fungril across long distances.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Fungril Network: Make an Instinct Roll (12) to use your 
mycelial array to speak with others of your ancestry. On a 
success, you can communicate across any distance.
Death Connection: While touching a corpse that died recently, 
you can mark a Stress to extract one memory from the corpse 
related to a specific emotion or sensation of your choice.
GALAPA
Galapa resemble anthropomorphic turtles with large, domed 
shells into which they can retract. On average, they range 
from 4 feet to 6 feet in height, and their head and body shapes 
can resemble any type of turtle. Galapa come in a variety of 
earth tonesâmost often shades of green and brownâ and 
possess unique patterns on their shells. Members of this 
ancestry can draw their head, arms, and legs into their shell 
for protection to use it as a natural shield when defensive 
measures are needed. Some supplement their shell's strength 
or appearance by attaching armor or carving unique designs, 
but the process is exceedingly painful. Most galapa move 
slowly no matter their age, and they can live approximately 
150 years.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Shell: Gain a bonus to your damage thresholds equal to your 
Proficiency. 
Retract: Mark a Stress to retract into your shell. While in 
your shell, you have resistance to physical damage, you have 
disadvantage on action rolls, and you canât move.
GIANT
Giants are towering humanoids with broad shoulders, long 
arms, and one to three eyes. Adult giants range from 6 Â½ to 
8 Â½ feet tall and are naturally muscular, regardless of body 
type. They are easily recognized by their wide frames and 
elongated arms and necks. Though they can have up to three 
eyes, all giants are born with none and remain sightless for 
their first year of life. Until a giant reaches the age of 10 and 
their features fully develop, the formation of their eyes may fluctuate. Those with a single eye are commonly known as 
cyclops. The average giant lifespan is about 75 years.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Endurance: Gain an additional Hit Point slot at character 
creation.
Reach: Treat any weapon, ability, spell, or other feature that 
has a Melee range as though it has a Very Close range instead.
GOBLIN
Goblins are small humanoids easily recognizable by their large 
eyes and massive membranous ears. With keen hearing and 
sharp eyesight, they perceive details both at great distances 
and in darkness, allowing them to move through less-optimal 
environments with ease. Their skin and eye colors are 
incredibly varied, with no one hue, either vibrant or subdued, 
more dominant than another. A typical goblin stands between 
3 feet and 4 feet tall, and each of their ears is about the size 
of their head. Goblins are known to use ear positions to very 
specific effect when communicating nonverbally. A goblinâs 
lifespan is roughly 100 years, and many maintain their keen 
hearing and sight well into advanced age.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Surefooted: You ignore disadvantage on Agility Rolls.
Danger Sense: Once per rest, mark a Stress to force an 
adversary to reroll an attack against you or an ally within Very 
Close range.
HALFLING
Halflings are small humanoids with large hairy feet and 
prominent rounded ears. On average, halflings are 3 to 4 
feet in height, and their ears, nose, and feet are larger in 
proportion to the rest of their body. Members of this ancestry 
live for around 150 years, and a halflingâs appearance is likely 
to remain youthful even as they progress from adulthood into 
old age. Halflings are naturally attuned to the magnetic fields 
of the Mortal Realm, granting them a strong internal compass. 
They also possess acute senses of hearing and smell, and can 
often detect those who are familiar to them by the sound of 
their movements.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Luckbringer: At the start of each session, everyone in your 
party gains a Hope.
Internal Compass: When you roll a 1 on your Hope Die, you 
can reroll it.

HUMAN
Humans are most easily recognized by their dexterous hands, 
rounded ears, and bodies built for endurance. Their average 
height ranges from just under 5 feet to about 6 Â½ feet. They 
have a wide variety of builds, with some being quite broad, 
others lithe, and many inhabiting the spectrum in between. 
Humans are physically adaptable and adjust to harsh climates 
with relative ease. In general, humans live to an age of about 
100, with their bodies changing dramatically between their 
youngest and oldest years.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
High Stamina: Gain an additional Stress slot at character 
creation.
Adaptability: When you fail a roll that utilized one of your 
Experiences, you can mark a Stress to reroll. 
INFERNIS
Infernis are humanoids who possess sharp canine teeth, 
pointed ears, and horns. They are the descendants of demons 
from the Circles Below. On average, infernis range in height 
from 5 feet to 7 feet and are known to have long fingers and 
pointed nails. Some have long, thin, and smooth tails that end 
in points, forks, or arrowheads. Itâs common for infernis to 
have two or four hornsâthough some have crowns of many 
horns, or only one. These horns can also grow asymmetrically, 
forming unique, often curving, shapes that infernis enhance 
with carving and ornamentation. Their skin, hair, and horns 
come in an assortment of colors that can include soft pastels, 
stark tones, or vibrant hues, such as rosy scarlet, deep purple, 
and pitch black. 
Infernis possess a âdread visageâ that manifests both 
involuntarily, such as when they experience fear or other 
strong emotions, or purposefully, such as when they wish to 
intimidate an adversary. This visage can briefly modify their 
appearance in a variety of ways, including lengthening their 
teeth and nails, changing the colors of their eyes, twisting 
their horns, or enhancing their height. On average, infernis live 
up to 350 years, with some attributing this lifespan to their 
demonic lineage.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Fearless: When you roll with Fear, you can mark 2 Stress to 
change it into a roll with Hope instead.
Dread Visage: You have advantage on rolls to intimidate hostile 
creatures.KATARI
Katari are feline humanoids with retractable claws, vertically 
slit pupils, and high, triangular ears. They can also have small, 
pointed canine teeth, soft fur, and long whiskers that assist 
their perception and navigation. Their ears can swivel nearly 
180 degrees to detect sound, adding to their heightened 
senses. Katari may look more or less feline or humanoid, with 
catlike attributes in the form of hair, whiskers, and a muzzle. 
About half of the katari population have tails. Their skin and 
fur come in a wide range of hues and patterns, including solid 
colors, calico tones, tabby stripes, and an array of spots, 
patches, marbling, or bands. Their height ranges from about 3 
feet to 6 Â½ feet, and they live to around 150 years. 
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Feline Instincts: When you make an Agility Roll, you can spend 
2 Hope to reroll your Hope Die. 
Retracting Claws: Make an Agility Roll to scratch a target 
within Melee range. On a success, they become temporarily 
Vulnerable.
ORC
Orcs are humanoids most easily recognized by their square 
features and boar-like tusks that protrude from their lower 
jaw. Tusks come in various sizes, and though they extend from 
the mouth, they arenât used for consuming food. Instead, 
many orcs choose to decorate their tusks with significant 
ornamentation. Orcs typically live for 125 years, and unless 
altered, their tusks continue to grow throughout the course 
of their lives. Their ears are pointed, and their hair and skin 
typically have green, blue, pink, or gray tones. Orcs tend 
toward a muscular build, and their average height ranges from 
5 feet to 6 Â½ feet. 
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Sturdy: When you have 1 Hit Point remaining, attacks against 
you have disadvantage. 
Tusks: When you succeed on an attack against a target within 
Melee range, you can spend a Hope to gore the target with 
your tusks, dealing an extra 1d6 damage.

RIBBET
Ribbets resemble anthropomorphic frogs with protruding 
eyes and webbed hands and feet. They have smooth (though 
sometimes warty) moist skin and eyes positioned on either 
side of their head. Some ribbets have hind legs more than 
twice the length of their torso, while others have short limbs. 
No matter their size (which ranges from about 3 feet to 4 
Â½ feet), ribbets primarily move by hopping. All ribbets have 
webbed appendages, allowing them to swim with ease. Some 
ribbets possess a natural green-and-brown camouflage, while 
others are vibrantly colored with bold patterns. No matter 
their appearance, all ribbets are born from eggs laid in the 
water, hatch into tadpoles, and after about 6 to 7 years, grow 
into amphibians that can move around on land. Ribbets live for 
approximately 100 years.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Amphibious: You can breathe and move naturally underwater.
Long Tongue: You can use your long tongue to grab onto things 
within Close range. Mark a Stress to use your tongue as a 
Finesse Close weapon that deals d12 physical damage using 
your Proficiency. 
SIMIAH
Simiah resemble anthropomorphic monkeys and apes with 
long limbs and prehensile feet. While their appearance 
reflects all simian creatures, from the largest gorilla to the 
smallest marmoset, their size does not align with their animal 
counterparts, and they can be anywhere from 2 to 6 feet 
tall. All simiah can use their dexterous feet for nonverbal 
communication, work, and combat. Additionally, some 
also have prehensile tails that can grasp objects or help 
with balance during difficult maneuvers. These traits grant 
members of this ancestry unique agility that aids them in 
a variety of physical tasks. In particular, simiah are skilled 
climbers and can easily transition from bipedal movement to 
knuckle-walking and climbing, and back again. On average, 
simiah live for about 100 years.
ANCESTRY FEATURES
Natural Climber: You have advantage on Agility Rolls that 
involve balancing and climbing.
Nimble: Gain a permanent +1 bonus to your Evasion at 
character creation.MIXED ANCESTRY
Families within the world of Daggerheart are as unique as the 
peoples and cultures that inhabit it. Anyoneâs appearance and 
abilities can be shaped by blood, magic, proximity, or a variety 
of other factors. 
If you decide that your character is a descendant of multiple 
ancestries and you want to mechanically represent that in the 
game, use the steps below:
1. Determine Ancestry Combination  
When you choose an ancestry at character creation, 
write down how your character identifies themself in the 
Heritage section of your character sheet. For example, if 
your character is descended from both goblins and orcs, 
you could use a hybridized term, such as âgoblin-orc,â to 
describe your ancestry, list only the ancestry you more 
closely identify with (e.g., just âgoblinâ or just âorcâ), or 
invent a new term, such as âtoothling.â
2. Choose Ancestry Features  
Work with your GM to choose two features from the 
ancestries in your characterâs lineage. You must choose 
the first feature from one ancestry and the second from 
another. Write both down on a notecard you can keep with 
your other cards or next to your character sheet. 
For example, if you are making a goblin-orc, you might take 
the âSurefootedâ and âTusksâ features or the âSturdyâ and 
âDanger Senseâ features. You canât take both the âSurefootedâ 
and âSturdyâ features, because these are both the first 
features listed on their respective ancestry cards.
Your character's heritage might include more than two 
ancestries, but you still only choose features from two. You 
can represent additional ancestries through their appearance 
or backstory.

COMMUNITIES
Communities represent a key aspect of the culture, class, or 
environment of origin that has had the most influence over 
your characterâs upbringing. 
Your characterâs community grants them a community 
feature. Each community card also lists six adjectives you 
can use as inspiration to create your characterâs personality, 
their relationship to their peers, their attitude toward their 
upbringing, or the demeanor with which they interact with the 
rest of the party.
HIGHBORNE
Being part of a highborne community means you're 
accustomed to a life of elegance, opulence, and prestige 
within the upper echelons of society. Traditionally, members 
of a highborne community possess incredible material 
wealth. While this can take a variety of forms depending on 
the communityâincluding gold and other minerals, land, 
or controlling the means of productionâthis status always 
comes with power and influence. Highborne place great value 
on titles and possessions, and there is little social mobility 
within their ranks. Members of a highborne community often 
control the political and economic status of the areas in 
which they live due to their ability to influence people and the 
economy with their substantial wealth. The health and safety 
of the less affluent people who live in these locations often 
hinges on the ability of this highborne ruling class to prioritize 
the well-being of their subjects over profit.
Highborne are often amiable, candid, conniving, enterprising, 
ostentatious, and unflappable.
COMMUNITY FEATURE
Privilege: You have advantage on rolls to consort with nobles, 
negotiate prices, or leverage your reputation to get what you 
want. LOREBORNE
Being part of a loreborne community means youâre from a 
society that favors strong academic or political prowess. 
Loreborne communities highly value knowledge, frequently 
in the form of historical preservation, political advancement, 
scientific study, skill development, or lore and mythology 
compilation. Most members of these communities research in 
institutions built in bastions of civilization, while some eclectic 
few thrive in gathering information from the natural world. 
Some may be isolationists, operating in smaller enclaves, 
schools, or guilds and following their own unique ethos. 
Others still wield their knowledge on a larger scale, making 
deft political maneuvers across governmental landscapes.
Loreborne are often direct, eloquent, inquisitive, patient, 
rhapsodic, and witty.
COMMUNITY FEATURE
Well-Read: You have advantage on rolls that involve the 
history, culture, or politics of a prominent person or place.
ORDERBORNE
Being part of an orderborne community means youâre from 
a collective that focuses on discipline or faith, and you 
uphold a set of principles that reflect your experience there. 
Orderborne are frequently some of the most powerful among 
the surrounding communities. By aligning the members of 
their society around a common value or goal, such as a god, 
doctrine, ethos, or even a shared business or trade, the ruling 
bodies of these enclaves can mobilize larger populations with 
less effort. While orderborne communities take a variety of 
formsâsome even profoundly pacifisticâperhaps the most 
feared are those that structure themselves around military 
prowess. In such a case, itâs not uncommon for orderborne to 
provide soldiers for hire to other cities or countries.
Orderborne are often ambitious, benevolent, pensive, prudent, 
sardonic, and stoic.
COMMUNITY FEATURE
Dedicated: Record three sayings or values your upbringing 
instilled in you. Once per rest, when you describe how youâre 
embodying one of these principles through your current 
action, you can roll a d20 as your Hope Die.
32
Daggerheart SRD

RIDGEBORNE
Being part of a ridgeborne community means youâve 
called the rocky peaks and sharp cliffs of the mountainside 
home. Those whoâve lived in the mountains often consider 
themselves hardier than most because theyâve thrived 
among the most dangerous terrain many continents have 
to offer. These groups are adept at adaptation, developing 
unique technologies and equipment to move both people 
and products across difficult terrain. As such, ridgeborne 
grow up scrambling and climbing, making them sturdy 
and strong-willed. Ridgeborne localities appear in a variety 
of formsâsome cities carve out entire cliff faces, others 
construct castles of stone, and still more live in small homes 
on windblown peaks. Outside forces often struggle to attack 
ridgeborne groups, as the small militias and large military 
forces of the mountains are adept at utilizing their high-ground 
advantage.
Ridgeborne are often bold, hardy, indomitable, loyal, reserved, 
and stubborn.
COMMUNITY FEATURE
Steady: You have advantage on rolls to traverse dangerous 
cliffs and ledges, navigate harsh environments, and use your 
survival knowledge.
SEABORNE
Being part of a seaborne community means you lived on or 
near a large body of water. Seaborne communities are built, 
both physically and culturally, around the specific waters 
they call home. Some of these groups live along the shore, 
constructing ports for locals and travelers alike. These harbors 
function as centers of commerce, tourist attractions, or 
even just a safe place to lay down oneâs head after weeks of 
travel. Other seaborne live on the water in small boats or large 
ships, with the idea of âhomeâ comprising a ship and its crew, 
rather than any one landmass. No matter their exact location, 
seaborne communities are closely tied to the ocean tides 
and the creatures who inhabit them. Seaborne learn to fish 
at a young age, and train from birth to hold their breath and 
swim in even the most tumultuous waters. Individuals from 
these groups are highly sought after for their sailing skills, 
and many become captains of vessels, whether within their 
own community, working for another, or even at the helm of a 
powerful naval operation.
Seaborne are often candid, cooperative, exuberant, fierce, 
resolute, and weathered.
COMMUNITY FEATURE
Know the Tide: You can sense the ebb and flow of life. When 
you roll with Fear, place a token on your community card. 
You can hold a number of tokens equal to your level. Before 
you make an action roll, you can spend any number of these 
tokens to gain a +1 bonus to the roll for each token spent. At 
the end of each session, clear all unspent tokens.SLYBORNE
Being part of a slyborne community means you come from 
a group that operates outside the law, including all manner 
of criminals, grifters, and con artists. Members of slyborne 
communities are brought together by their disreputable 
goals and their clever means of achieving them. Many people 
in these communities have an array of unscrupulous skills: 
forging, thievery, smuggling, and violence. People of any social 
class can be slyborne, from those who have garnered vast 
wealth and influence to those without a coin to their name. T o 
the outside eye, slyborne might appear to be ruffians with no 
loyalty, but these communities possess some of the strictest 
codes of honor which, when broken, can result in a terrifying 
end for the transgressor.
Slyborne are often calculating, clever, formidable, perceptive, 
shrewd, and tenacious.
COMMUNITY FEATURE
Scoundrel: You have advantage on rolls to negotiate with 
criminals, detect lies, or find a safe place to hide.
UNDERBORNE
Being part of an underborne community means youâre from a 
subterranean society. Many underborne live right beneath the 
cities and villages of other collectives, while some live much 
deeper. These communities range from small family groups 
in burrows to massive metropolises in caverns of stone. In 
many locales, underborne are recognized for their incredible 
boldness and skill that enable great feats of architecture 
and engineering. Underborne are regularly hired for their 
bravery, as even the least daring among them has likely 
encountered formidable belowground beasts, and learning to 
dispatch such creatures is common practice amongst these 
societies. Because of the dangers of their environment, many 
underborne communities develop unique nonverbal languages 
that prove equally useful on the surface.
Underborne are often composed, elusive, indomitable, 
innovative, resourceful, and unpretentious.
COMMUNITY FEATURE
Low-Light Living: When youâre in an area with low light 
or heavy shadow, you have advantage on rolls to hide, 
investigate, or perceive details within that area.
33
Daggerheart SRD

WANDERBORNE
Being part of a wanderborne community means youâve lived as 
a nomad, forgoing a permanent home and experiencing a wide 
variety of cultures. Unlike many communities that are defined 
by their locale, wanderborne are defined by their traveling 
lifestyle. Because of their frequent migration, wanderborne 
put less value on the accumulation of material possessions in 
favor of acquiring information, skills, and connections. While 
some wanderborne are allied by a common ethos, such as a 
religion or a set of political or economic values, others come 
together after shared tragedy, such as the loss of their home 
or land. No matter the reason, the dangers posed by life on 
the road and the choice to continue down that road together 
mean that wanderborne are known for their unwavering 
loyalty.
Wanderborne are often inscrutable, magnanimous, mirthful, 
reliable, savvy, and unorthodox.
COMMUNITY FEATURE
Nomadic Pack: Add a Nomadic Pack to your inventory. Once 
per session, you can spend a Hope to reach into this pack and 
pull out a mundane item thatâs useful to your situation. Work 
with the GM to figure out what item you take out.WILDBORNE
Being part of a wildborne community means you lived deep 
within the forest. Wildborne communities are defined by their 
dedication to the conservation of their homelands, and many 
have strong religious or cultural ties to the fauna they live 
among. This results in unique architectural and technological 
advancements that favor sustainability over short-term, 
high-yield results. It is a hallmark of wildborne societies to 
integrate their villages and cities with the natural environment 
and avoid disturbing the lives of the plants and animals. While 
some construct their lodgings high in the branches of trees, 
others establish their homes on the ground beneath the forest 
canopy. Itâs not uncommon for wildborne to remain reclusive 
and hidden within their woodland homes. 
Wildborne are often hardy, loyal, nurturing, reclusive, sagacious, 
and vibrant.
COMMUNITY FEATURE
Lightfoot: Your movement is naturally silent. You have 
advantage on rolls to move without being heard.

Daggerheart SRD

CORE MECHANICS
FLOW OF THE GAME
Daggerheart is a conversation. The GM describes fictional 
scenarios involving the PCs, and the players take turns 
describing how their characters react. The goal of every 
person at the table is to build upon everyone elseâs ideas and 
collaboratively tell a satisfying story. The system facilitates 
this collaborative process by providing structure to the 
conversation and mechanics for resolving moments of tension 
where fate or fortune determine the outcome of events.
PLA YER PRINCIPLES  
& BEST PRACTICES
T o get the most out of Daggerheart, we recommend players 
keep the following principles and practices in mind throughout 
each session:
PRINCIPLES
â¢ Be a fan of your character and their journey.
â¢ Spotlight your friends.
â¢ Address the characters and address the players.
â¢ Build the world together.
â¢ Play to find out what happens.
â¢ Hold on gently.
BEST PRACTICES
â¢ Embrace danger.
â¢ Use your resources.
â¢ T ell the story.
â¢ Discover your character.
For more information, see the Daggerheart Core Rulebook, 
pages 9 and 108.
Core Gameplay 
Loop
The core gameplay loop is the procedure that drives every 
scene, both in and out of combat:
STEP 1: 
SET THE SCENE
The GM describes a scenario, establishing the PCsâ 
surroundings and any dangers, NPCs, or other important 
details the characters would notice.STEP 2
ASK AND ANSWER QUESTIONS
The players ask clarifying questions to explore the scene 
more deeply and gather information that could inform their 
charactersâ actions. The GM responds to these questions by 
giving the players information their characters could easily 
obtain, or by asking questions of their own to the players. The 
players also respond to any questions the GM poses to them. 
In this way, the table builds out the fiction collaboratively.
STEP 3
BUILD ON THE FICTION
As the scene develops, the players find opportunities to take 
actionâproblems to solve, obstacles to overcome, mysteries 
to investigate, and so on. The players describe how their 
characters proceed; if their proposed actions carry no chance 
of failure (or if failure would be boring), they automatically 
succeed. But if the outcome of their action is unknown, 
the GM calls for an action roll. Either way, the table works 
the outcome into the story and moves the fiction forward, 
narrating how the PCâs actions have changed things.
STEP 4
GO BACK TO STEP 1
The process repeats from the beginning, with the GM relaying 
any updated details or material changes to the players. This 
process continues until the end of the scene is triggered by a 
mechanic or arrives organically.
The Spotlight
The spotlight is a symbol that represents the tableâs 
attentionâand therefore the immediate focus of both the 
narrative and the game mechanics. Any time a character 
or player becomes the focus of a scene, they âare in the 
spotlightâ or âhave the spotlight.â 
The spotlight moves around the table organically as scenes 
unfold unless a mechanical trigger determines where the 
spotlight goes next. For example, when a player fails an action 
roll, the mechanics prompt the GM to seize the spotlight and 
make a GM move.
35
Daggerheart SRD

Turn Order & 
Action Economy
Daggerheartâs turns donât follow a traditional, rigid format: 
there is no explicit initiative mechanic and characters donât 
have a set number of actions they can take or things they can 
do before the spotlight passes to someone else. A player with 
the spotlight describes what their character does and the 
spotlight simply swings to whoever: 
A. the fiction would naturally turn it toward
B. hasnât had the focus in a while, or 
C. a triggered mechanic puts it on
Optional: Spotlight Tracker Tool
If your group prefers a more traditional action economy, 
you can use tokens to track how many times a player has 
had the spotlight: At the start of a session or scene, each 
player adds a certain number of tokens (we recommend 
3) to their character sheet and removes a token each 
time they take an action. If the spotlight would swing to 
someone without any tokens, it swings to someone else 
instead. Once every player has used all their available 
tokens, players refill their character sheet with the same 
number of tokens as before, then continue playing.
MAKING MOVES & 
TAKING ACTION
Any time a character does something to advance the story, 
such as speaking with another character, interacting with the 
environment, making an attack, casting a spell, or using a 
class feature, they are making a move.
ACTION ROLLS
Any move where success would be trivial or failure would be 
boring automatically succeeds, but any move thatâs difficult to 
accomplish or risky to attempt triggers an action roll.
OVERVIEW
All action rolls require a pair of d12s called Duality Dice. 
These are two visually distinct twelve-sided dice, with one die 
representing Hope and the other representing Fear.
T o make an action roll, you roll the Duality Dice, sum the 
results, apply any relevant modifiers, and compare the total to 
a Difficulty number to determine the outcome:
â¢ Success with Hope: If your total meets or beats the 
Difficulty AND your Hope Die shows a higher result than 
your Fear Die, you rolled a âSuccess with Hope.â You 
succeed and gain a Hope.
â¢ Success with Fear: If your total meets or beats the 
Difficulty AND your Fear Die shows a higher result than 
your Hope Die, you rolled a âSuccess with Fear.â You 
succeed with a cost or complication, but the GM gains a 
Fear.â¢ Failure with Hope: If your total is less than the Difficulty 
AND your Hope Die shows a higher result than your Fear 
Die, you rolled a âFailure with Hope.â You fail with a minor 
consequence and gain a Hope, then the spotlight swings 
to the GM.
â¢ Failure with Fear: If your total is less than the Difficulty 
AND your Fear Die shows a higher result than your Hope 
Die, you rolled a âFailure with Fear.â You fail with a major 
consequence and the GM gains a Fear, then the spotlight 
swings to the GM.
â¢ Critical Success: If the Duality Dice show matching 
results, you rolled a âCritical Successâ (âCritâ). You 
automatically succeed with a bonus, gain a Hope, and 
clear a Stress. If this was an attack roll, you deal critical 
damage. 
Note: A Critical Success counts as a roll âwith Hope.â
After resolving the action roll, the table works together to 
weave the outcome into the narrative and play continues.
FAILING FORWARD
In Daggerheart, every time you roll the dice, the scene 
changes in some way. There is no such thing as a roll where 
ânothing happens,â because the fiction constantly evolves 
based on the successes and failures of the characters.
PROCEDURE
The following steps describe in more detail the procedure that 
all action rolls utilize:
STEP 1: PICK AN APPROPRIATE TRAIT
Some actions and effects specify in their description which 
trait applies to the roll; otherwise, the GM tells the acting 
player which character trait best applies to the action being 
attempted. If more than one trait could apply to the roll, the 
GM chooses or lets the acting player decide. 
STEP 2: DETERMINE THE DIFFICULTY
Some actions and features say in their description what the 
Difficulty is. Otherwise, the GM determines the Difficulty 
based on the scenario. The GM can choose whether to share 
the Difficulty with the table. In either case, the GM should 
communicate the potential consequences of failure to the 
acting player.
STEP 3: APPLY EXTRA DICE AND MODIFIERS
The acting player decides whether to Utilize an Experience or 
activate other effects, then, if applicable, adds the appropriate 
tokens and dice (such as advantage or Rally dice) to their dice 
pool. 
Note: Unless an action, ability, or feature specifically allows 
for it, a player must declare the use of any Experiences, extra 
dice, or other modifiers before they roll.
36
Daggerheart SRD

STEP 4: ROLL THE DICE
The acting player rolls their entire dice pool and announces 
the results in the format of â[total result] with [Hope/Fear]ââ
or âCritical Success!â in the case of matching Duality Dice. 
Example: A player is making an action roll with a +1 in the 
relevant trait and no other modifiers; they roll the Duality 
Dice and get a result of 5 on their Hope Die and 7 on their 
Fear Die, then announce âI rolled a 13 with Fear!â
STEP 5: RESOLVE THE OUTCOME
The active player and the GM work together, along with the 
suggestions and support of the rest of the table, to resolve the 
outcome of the action.
GM MOVES AND  
ADVERSARY ACTIONS
GMs also make moves. They should consider making a move 
when a player does one of the following things:
â¢ Rolls with Fear on an action roll.
â¢ Fails an action roll.
â¢ Does something that would have consequences.
â¢ Gives them a golden opportunity.
â¢ Looks to them for what happens next.
After the GM turn is done, the spotlight goes back to the PCs.
Many adversaries and environments have Fear Features, 
especially powerful or consequential moves that the GM must 
spend Fear to activate.
Note: This Fear is in addition to any Fear the GM has 
previously spent to seize the spotlight or activate another 
action or ability.
ADVERSARY ACTIONS
When play passes to the GM, the GM can make a GM move to 
spotlight an adversary. A spotlighted adversary can:
â¢ Move within Close range and make a standard attack
â¢ Move within Close range and use an adversary action
â¢ Clear a condition
â¢ Sprint within Far or Very Far range on the battlefield
â¢ Do anything else the fiction demands or the GM deems 
appropriate
The GM can spend additional Fear to spotlight additional 
adversaries. Once the GM has finished, the spotlight swings 
back to the PCs.
SPECIAL ROLLS
Some rolls have unique specifications or otherwise modify 
the action roll procedure: trait rolls, Spellcast Rolls, attack 
rolls, and damage rolls. Unless otherwise noted, you can apply 
any bonus, modifier, or effect to a special roll as if it were a 
standard action roll.TRAIT ROLLS
An action roll that specifies which character trait applies to it 
is called a trait roll. In the text of a feature or effect, a trait roll 
is referenced with the format â[Trait] Roll (Difficulty)â (e.g., 
âAgility Roll (12)â). If the text of an effect doesnât specify a 
trait rollâs Difficulty, the GM sets the Difficulty based on the 
circumstances.
Features and effects that affect a trait roll also affect any 
action roll that uses the same trait, including attack rolls, 
Spellcast rolls, and standard action rolls. 
Example: The katariâs ancestry feature âFeline Instincts,â 
which allows the katari to reroll an Agility Roll, can also 
be used on a standard action roll using Agility to traverse 
dangerous terrain or on an attack roll made with a 
weapon that uses Agility.
SPELLCAST ROLLS
Spellcast Rolls are trait rolls that require you to use your 
Spellcast trait. Your Spellcast trait, if you have one, is 
determined by your subclass.
Spellcast Rolls are only made when a character uses a feature 
that requires one. A successful Spellcast Roll activates the 
effect as described by the feature. 
Notes:
A Spellcast Roll that can damage a target is also considered 
an attack roll.
When you cast a spell, the text tells you when the effect ends. 
The GM can spend a Fear to end a temporary effect. If your 
spell doesnât specify when it ends, it ends when you choose or 
at a natural moment of the story. You can choose to end your 
spell early.
You can cast and maintain the effects of more than one spell 
at the same time. 
REACTION ROLLS
A reaction roll is made in response to an attack or a hazard, 
representing a characterâs attempt to avoid or withstand an 
imminent effect.
Reaction rolls work like action rolls, except they donât generate 
Hope or Fear, donât trigger additional GM moves, and other 
characters canât aid you with Help an Ally.
If you critically succeed on a reaction roll, you donât clear 
a Stress or gain a Hope, but you do ignore any effects that 
would have impacted you on a success, such as taking 
damage or marking Stress.

GROUP ACTION ROLLS
When multiple PCs take action together, the party chooses 
one PC to lead the action. Each other player then describes 
how their character collaborates on the task. The leader 
makes an action roll as usual, while the other players make 
reaction rolls using whichever traits they and the GM decide 
fit best.
The lead character gains a +1 bonus to their lead action roll for 
each of these reaction rolls that succeeded and a â1 penalty 
for each these reaction rolls that failed.
TAG TEAM ROLLS
Each player can, once per session, initiate a Tag Team Roll 
between their character and another PC by spending 3 Hope. 
The players work with one another to describe how they 
combine their actions in a unique and exciting way. Both 
players make separate action rolls; before resolving the rollâs 
outcome, choose one of the rolls to apply to both actions. On 
a roll with Hope, all PCs involved gain a Hope. On a roll with 
Fear, the GM gains a Fear token for each PC involved. 
On a successful Tag T eam attack roll, both players roll damage 
and add the totals together to determine the damage dealt, 
which is then treated as if it came from a single source. If the 
attacks deal different types of damage, the players choose 
which type to deal.
Notes:
A Tag Team Roll counts as a single action roll for the 
purposes of any countdowns or features that track action 
rolls.
Though each player may only initiate one Tag Team Roll per 
session, one PC can be involved in multiple Tag Team Rolls.
ADVANTAGE & DISADVANTAGE
Some features and effects let you roll with advantage or 
disadvantage on an action or reaction roll:
â¢ Advantage represents an opportunity that you seize to 
increase your chances of success. When you roll with 
advantage, you roll a d6 advantage die with your dice pool 
and add its result to your total.
â¢ Disadvantage represents an additional difficulty, hardship, 
or challenge you face when attempting an action. When 
you roll with disadvantage, you roll a d6 disadvantage die 
with your dice pool and subtract its result from your total.
Advantage or disadvantage can be granted or imposed by 
mechanical triggers or at the GMâs discretion. When a PC aids 
you with Help an Ally, they roll their own advantage die and 
you add it to your total.
Advantage and disadvantage dice cancel each out, one-for-
one, when they would be added to the same dice pool, so 
youâll never roll both at the same time. If you have advantage 
or disadvantage from other sources that donât affect your own 
dice pool, such as another playerâs Help an Ally move, their 
effects stack with your rolled results.HOPE & FEAR
Hope and Fear are metacurrencies representing the cosmic 
forces that shape the events of your tableâs story. Hope 
powers PC abilities and features, while Fear powers the 
abilities of the GM and the adversaries and environments they 
control.
HOPE
Every PC starts with 2 Hope at character creation and gains 
more throughout play. A PC can have a maximum of 6 Hope at 
one time, and Hope carries over between sessions.
Players can spend Hope to:
â¢ Help an Ally 
When you Help an Ally who is making an action roll, 
describe how you do so and roll an advantage die. Multiple 
players can spend Hope to help the same acting player, 
but that player only adds the highest result to their final 
total.
â¢ Utilize an Experience  
When you Utilize an Experience on a relevant roll, add its 
modifier to the result. You can spend multiple Hope to 
utilize multiple Experiences.
â¢ Initiate a Tag Team Roll 
Spend 3 Hope to initiate a Tag T eam roll, combining the 
actions of two PCs into one impressive act of synergy. 
When you make a Tag T eam roll, both players roll their 
action rolls and then choose which set of results to apply 
to the outcome.
â¢ Activate a Hope Feature  
A Hope Feature is any effect that allows (or requires) you 
to spend a specified amount of Hope to activate it. Class 
Hope features are class-specific features, detailed on your 
character sheet, that cost 3 Hope to activate. 
Note: When using a Hope Feature, if you rolled with Hope 
for that action, the Hope you gain from that roll can be spent 
on that feature (or toward it, if it requires spending multiple 
Hope).
FEAR
The GM gains Fear whenever a player rolls with Fear and can 
spend Fear at any time to make or enhance a GM move or to 
use a Fear Feature. The GM can have up to 12 Fear at one 
time. Fear carries over between sessions.

Daggerheart SRD

COMBAT
Though Daggerheart relies on the same flow of collaborative 
storytelling in and out of combat, physical conflicts rely 
more heavily on several key mechanics related to attacking, 
maneuvering, and taking damage.
EVASION
Evasion represents a characterâs ability to avoid attacks and 
other unwanted effects. Any roll made against a PC has a 
Difficulty equal to the targetâs Evasion. A PCâs base Evasion 
is determined by their class, but can be modified by domain 
cards, equipment, conditions, and other effects. 
Note: attacks rolled against adversaries use the targetâs 
Difficulty instead of Evasion.
HIT POINTS & DAMAGE 
THRESHOLDS
Hit Points (HP) represent a characterâs ability to withstand 
physical injury. When a character takes damage, they mark 1 
to 3 HP, based on their damage thresholds:
â¢ If the final damage is at or above the characterâs Severe 
damage threshold, they mark 3 HP.
â¢ If the final damage is at or above the characterâs Major 
damage threshold but below their Severe damage 
threshold, they mark 2 HP.
â¢ If the final damage is below the characterâs Major damage 
threshold, they mark 1 HP.
â¢ If incoming damage is ever reduced to 0 or less, no HP is 
marked. 
A PCâs damage thresholds are calculated by adding their level 
to the listed damage thresholds of their equipped armor. A 
PCâs starting HP is based on their class, but they can gain 
additional Hit Points through advancements, features, and 
other effects.
An adversaryâs Damage Thresholds and HP are listed in their 
stat blocks.
When a character marks their last Hit Point, they fall. If a PC 
falls, they make a death move.
Characters can clear Hit Points by taking downtime moves 
(see: Downtime) or by activating relevant special abilities or 
effects.
Optional Rule: Massive Damage
If a character ever takes damage equal to twice their 
Severe threshold, they mark 4 HP instead of 3.STRESS
Stress represents how much mental, physical, and emotional 
strain a character can endure. Some special abilities or effects 
require the character activating them to mark Stress, and 
the GM can require a PC to mark Stress as a GM move or to 
represent the cost, complication, or consequence of an action 
roll. 
When a character marks their last Stress, they become 
Vulnerable (see: Conditions) until they clear at least 1 Stress. 
When a character must mark 1 or more Stress but canât, they 
mark 1 HP instead. A character canât use a move that requires 
them to mark Stress if all of their Stress is marked. 
PCs can clear Stress by making downtime moves (see: 
Downtime). A PCâs maximum Stress is determined by their 
class, but they can increase it through advancements, abilities, 
and other effects.
ATTACKING
ATTACK ROLLS
An attack roll is an action roll intended to inflict harm. The 
trait that applies to an attack roll is specified by the weapon 
or spell being used. Unarmed attack rolls use either Strength 
or Finesse (GMâs choice). An attack rollâs Difficulty, unless 
otherwise noted, is equal to the Difficulty score of its target.
DAMAGE ROLLS
On a successful attack, roll damage. Damage is calculated 
from the damage roll listed in the attackâs description with the 
format âxdy+[modifier]â (e.g., for a spell that inflicts â1d8+2â 
damage, you roll an eight-sided and add 2 to the result; the 
damage dealt is equal to the total).
Any time an effect says to deal damage using your Spellcast 
trait, you roll a number of dice equal to your Spellcast trait. 
Note: If your Spellcast trait is +0 or lower, you donât roll 
anything.
For weapons, the number of damage dice you roll is equal 
to your Proficiency. Note that your Proficiency multiplies the 
number of dice you roll, but doesnât affect the modifier. For 
example, a PC with Proficiency 2 and wielding a weapon with a 
damage rating of âd8+2â deals damage equal to â2d8+2â on a 
successful attack. 
Successful unarmed attacks inflict [Proficiency]d4 damage.
CRITICAL DAMAGE
When you get a critical success (i.e., you roll matching values 
on your Duality Dice) on an attack roll, you deal extra damage. 
Make the damage roll as usual, but add the maximum possible 
result of the damage dice to the final total. For instance, if an 
attack would normally deal 2d8+1 damage, a critical success 
would deal 2d8+1+16.
39
Daggerheart SRD

DAMAGE TYPES
There are two damage types: physical damage (phy) and 
magic damage (mag). Unless stated otherwise, mundane 
weapons and unarmed attacks deal physical damage, and 
spells deal magic damage.
RESISTANCE, IMMUNITY, AND DIRECT 
DAMAGE
If a target has resistance to a damage type, then they reduce 
incoming damage of that type by half before comparing it to 
their Hit Point Thresholds. If the target has additional ways 
of reducing incoming damage, such as marking Armor Slots, 
they apply the resistance effect first. The effects of multiple 
resistances to the same damage type do not stack.
If a target has immunity to a damage type, they ignore 
incoming damage of that type.
If an attack deals both physical and magic damage, a 
character can only benefit from resistance or immunity if they 
are resistant or immune to both damage types.
Direct damage is damage that canât be reduced by marking 
Armor Slots.
MULTI-TARGET ATTACK ROLLS
If a spell or ability allows you to target multiple adversaries, 
make one attack roll and one damage roll, then apply the 
results to each target individually. 
MULTIPLE DAMAGE SOURCES
Damage dealt simultaneously from multiple sources is always 
totaled before itâs compared to its targetâs damage thresholds. 
For example, if a PC with orc ancestry makes a successful 
attack against a target in Melee range and decides to 
spend a Hope to use their âTusksâ feature (which gives 
them an extra 1d6 damage on a damage roll), they would 
roll their normal weapon damage and add a d6 to the 
result, then deal that total damage to the adversary.
MAPS, RANGE,  
AND MOVEMENT
You can play Daggerheart using âtheater of the mindâ or maps 
and miniatures. The conversions below from abstract ranges 
to physical measurements assume 1 inch of map represents 
about 5 feet of fictional space.
Daggerheart uses the following ranges to translate fictional 
positioning into relative distance for the purposes of targeting, 
movement, and other game mechanics:
Melee: Close enough to touch, up to a few feet away.
Very Close: Close enough to see fine details, about 5â10 
feet away. While in danger, a character can move, as part 
of their action, from Very Close range into Melee range. On 
a map: anything within the shortest length of a game card 
(2-3 inches).Close: Close enough to see prominent details, about 
10â30 feet away. While in danger, a character can move, 
as part of their action, from Close range into Melee range. 
On a map: anything within the length of a pencil (5-6 inches).
Far: Close enough to see very little detail, about 30â100 
feet away. While in danger, a character must make an 
Agility Roll to safely move from Far range into Melee range. 
On a map: anything within the length of the long edge of a 
piece of copy paper (11â12 inches).
Very Far: T oo far to make out any details, about 100â300 
feet away. While in danger, a character must make an 
Agility Roll to safely move from Very Far range into Melee 
range. On a map: anything beyond Far range, but still within 
the bounds of the conflict or scene.
Out of Range: Anything beyond a characterâs Very Far 
range is Out of Range and usually canât be targeted.
Range is measured from the source of an effect, such as the 
attacker or spellcaster, to the target or object of an effect.
A weapon, spell, ability, item, or other effectâs stated range is 
a maximum range; unless otherwise noted, it can be used at 
closer distances.
Optional Rule: Defined Ranges
If your table would rather operate with more precise range 
rules, you can use a 1-inch grid battle map during combat. 
If you do, use the following guidelines for play:
â¢ Melee: 1 square
â¢ Very Close: 3 squares
â¢ Close: 6 squares
â¢ Far: 12 squares
â¢ Very Far: 13+ squares
â¢ Out of Range: Off the battlemap
MOVEMENT UNDER PRESSURE
When youâre under pressure or in danger and make an action 
roll, you can move to a location within Close range as part of 
that action. If youâre not already making an action roll, or if 
you want to move farther than your Close range, you need to 
succeed on an Agility Roll to safely reposition yourself.
An adversary can move within Close range for free as part of 
an action, or within Very Far range as a separate action.
AREA OF EFFECT
Unless stated otherwise, all the targets of a group effect must 
be within Very Close range of a single origin point within your 
effectâs range.
LINE OF SIGHT & COVER
Unless stated otherwise, a ranged attacker must have line 
of sight to their intended target to make an attack roll. If a 
partial obstruction lies between the attacker and target, the 
target has cover. Attacks made through cover are rolled with 
disadvantage. If the obstruction is total, there is no line of 
sight.
40
Daggerheart SRD

CONDITIONS
Conditions are effects that grant specific benefits or 
drawbacks to the target they are attached to. 
STANDARD CONDITIONS
Daggerheart has three standard conditions:
HIDDEN
While youâre out of sight from all enemies and they 
donât otherwise know your location, you gain the Hidden 
condition. Any rolls against a Hidden creature have 
disadvantage. After an adversary moves to where they 
would see you, you move into their line of sight, or you 
make an attack, you are no longer Hidden.
RESTRAINED
Restrained characters canât move, but you can still take 
actions from their current position.
VULNERABLE
When a creature is Vulnerable, all rolls targeting them have 
advantage. 
Some features can apply special or unique conditions, which 
work as described in the feature text.
Unless otherwise noted, the same condition canât be applied 
more than once to the same target.
TEMPORARY TAGS  
& SPECIAL CONDITIONS
The temporary tag denotes a condition or effect that the 
affected creature can clear by making a move against it. When 
an affected PC makes a move to clear a temporary condition 
or effect, it normally requires a successful action roll using 
an appropriate trait. When an affected adversary makes a 
move to clear a temporary condition or effect, the GM puts 
the spotlight on the adversary and describes how they do it; 
this doesnât require a roll but it does use up that adversaryâs 
spotlight.
Special conditions are only cleared when specific requirements 
are met, such as completing a certain action or using a 
particular item. The requirements for clearing these conditions 
are stated in the text of the effect that applies the condition.
DOWNTIME
Between conflicts, the party can take a rest to recover 
expended resources and deepen their bonds. During a rest, 
each PC can make up to two downtime moves.
When the party rests, they must choose between a short rest 
and a long rest. If a party takes three short rests in a row, their 
next rest must be a long rest.
If a short rest is interrupted, such as by an adversary's 
attack, the characters donât gain its benefits. If a long rest is 
interrupted, the characters only gain the benefits of a short rest. 
A short rest lasts enough time for the party to catch its 
breath, about an hour in-world. Each player can move domain 
cards between their loadout and vault for free, then choose 
twice from the following list of downtime moves (players can 
choose the same move twice):
â¢ Tend to Wounds: Clear 1d4+Tier Hit Points for yourself or 
an ally.
â¢ Clear Stress: Clear 1d4+Tier Stress.
â¢ Repair Armor: Clear 1d4+Tier Armor Slots from your or an 
allyâs armor.
â¢ Prepare: Describe how you prepare yourself for the path 
ahead, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare with one 
or more members of your party, you each gain 2 Hope.
At the end of a short rest, any features or effects with a 
limited number of uses per rest refresh and any features or 
effects that last until your next rest expire. 
A long rest is when the characters make camp and relax or 
sleep for several in-game hours. Each player can move domain 
cards between their loadout and vault for free, then choose 
twice from the following list of downtime moves (players can 
choose the same move twice):
â¢ Tend to All Wounds: Clear all Hit Points for yourself or an 
ally.
â¢ Clear All Stress: Clear all Stress.
â¢ Repair All Armor: Clear all Armor Slots from your or an 
allyâs armor 
â¢ Prepare: Describe how you prepare for the next dayâs 
adventure, then gain a Hope. If you choose to Prepare 
with one or more members of your party, you each gain 2 
Hope.
â¢ Work on a Project: With GM approval, a PC may pursue 
a long-term project, such as deciphering an ancient text 
or crafting a new weapon. The first time they start a new 
project, assign it a countdown. Each time a PC makes 
the Work on a Project move, they either advance their 
projectâs countdown automatically or make an action roll 
to advance it (GMâs choice).
At the end of a long rest, any features or effects with a limited 
number of uses per rest or per long rest refresh and any 
features or effects that last until your next rest or until your 
next long rest expire. 
DOWNTIME CONSEQUENCES
On a short rest, the GM gains 1d4 Fear. On a long rest, they 
gain Fear equal to 1d4 + the number of PCs, and they can 
advance a long-term countdown of their choice.
41
Daggerheart SRD

DEATH
When a PC marks their last Hit Point, they must make a death 
move  by choosing one of the following options:
â¢ Blaze of Glory: Your character embraces death and 
goes out in a blaze of glory. Take one final action. It 
automatically critically succeeds (with GM approval), and 
then you cross through the veil of death.
â¢ Avoid Death: Your character avoids death and faces the 
consequences. They temporarily drop unconscious, and 
then you work with the GM to describe how the situation 
worsens. While unconscious, your character canât move or 
act, and they canât be targeted by an attack. They return 
to consciousness when an ally clears 1 or more of their 
marked Hit Points or when the party finishes a long rest. 
After your character falls unconscious, roll your Hope Die. 
If its value is equal to or less than your characterâs level, 
they gain a scar: permanently cross out a Hope slot and 
work with the GM to determine its lasting narrative impact 
and how, if possible, it can be restored. If you ever cross 
out your last Hope slot, your characterâs journey ends.
â¢ Risk It All: Roll your Duality Dice. If the Hope Die is higher, 
your character stays on their feet and clears a number 
of Hit Points or Stress equal to the value of the Hope Die 
(you can divide the Hope Die value between Hit Points and 
Stress however youâd prefer). If the Fear Die is higher, your 
character crosses through the veil of death. If the Duality 
Dice show matching results, your character stays up and 
clears all Hit Points and Stress.
If your character dies, work with the GM before the next 
session to create a new character at the current level of the 
rest of the party.
ADDITIONAL RULES
The following rules apply to many aspects of the game.
ROUNDING UP
This game doesnât use fractions; if you need to round to a 
whole number, round up unless otherwise specified. When in 
doubt, resolve any ambiguity in favor of the PCs.
REROLLING DICE
When a feature allows you to reroll a die, you always take the 
new result unless the feature specifically says otherwise.
INCOMING DAMAGE
Incoming damage means the total damage from a single 
attack or source, before Armor Slots are marked.
SIMULTANEOUS EFFECTS
If the resolution order of multiple effects is unclear, the person 
in control of the effects (player or GM) decides what order to 
resolve them in.STACKING EFFECTS
Unless stated otherwise, all effects beside conditions and 
advantage/disadvantage can stack.
ONGOING SPELL EFFECTS
If an effect doesnât have a listed mechanical expiration, it only 
ends when decided by the controlling player, the GM, or the 
demands of the fiction.
SPENDING RESOURCES
Unless an effect states otherwise, you canât spend Hope or 
mark Stress multiple times on the same feature to increase or 
repeat its effects on the same roll.
USING FEATURES AFTER A ROLL
If a feature allows you to affect a roll after the result has been 
totaled, you can use it after the GM declares whether the roll 
succeeds or fails, but not after the consequences unfold or 
another roll is made. 
LEVELING UP
Your party levels up whenever the GM decides youâve reached 
a narrative milestone (usually about every 3 sessions). All 
party members level up at the same time.
Daggerheart has 10 PC levels divided into 4 tiers:
 âTier 1 encompasses level 1 only.
 âTier 2 encompasses levels 2â4.
 âTier 3 encompasses levels 5â7.
 âTier 4 encompasses levels 8â10.
Your tier affects your damage thresholds, tier achievements, 
and access to advancements.
STEP ONE
TIER ACHIEVEMENTS
Take any applicable tier achievements
â¢ At level 2, you gain a new Experience at +2 and 
permanently increase your Proficiency by 1.
â¢ At level 5, you gain a new Experience at +2, permanently 
increase your Proficiency by 1, and clear any marked traits.
â¢ At level 8, you gain a new Experience at +2, permanently 
increase your Proficiency by 1, and clear any marked traits.
42
Daggerheart SRD

STEP TWO
ADVANCEMENTS
Choose any two advancements with at least one unmarked 
slot from your tier or below. Options with multiple slots can be 
chosen more than once. When you choose an advancement, 
mark one of its slots.
â¢ When you choose to increase two unmarked character 
traits and mark them: Choose two unmarked character 
traits and gain a permanent +1 bonus to them. You canât 
increase these stats again until the next tier (when your 
tier achievement allows you to clear those marks).
â¢ When you choose to permanently add 1 or more Hit Point 
slots: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the Hit 
Point section of your character sheet in pen or permanent 
marker.
â¢ When you choose to permanently add 1 or more Stress 
slots: Darken the outline of the next rectangle in the Stress 
section of your character sheet in pen or permanent 
marker.
â¢ When you choose to increase an Experience: Gain a 
permanent +1 bonus to an Experience.
â¢ When you take an additional domain card: You can choose 
an additional domain card at or below your level or from 
your classâs domains. If youâve multiclassed, you can 
instead select a card at or below half your level from your 
chosen multiclass domain.
â¢ When you choose to increase your Evasion: Gain a 
permanent +1 bonus to your Evasion.
â¢ When you choose to take an upgraded subclass card: 
Take the next card for your subclass. If you have only 
the foundation card, take a specialization; if you have a 
specialization already, take a mastery. Then cross out this 
tierâs multiclass option.
â¢ When you choose to increase your Proficiency: Fill in one 
of the open circles in the âProficiencyâ section of your 
character sheet, then increase your weaponâs number of 
damage dice by 1. The black box around this advancementâs 
slots indicates you must spend two advancements and mark 
both level-up slots in order to take it as an option.
â¢ When you choose to multiclass: Choose an additional class, 
select one of its domains, and gain its class feature. Add 
the appropriate multiclass module to your character sheet 
and take the foundation card from one of its subclasses. 
Then cross out the âupgraded subclassâ advancement 
option in this tier and all other âmulticlassâ advancement 
options on your character sheet. The black box around 
this advancementâs slots indicates you must spend two 
advancements and mark both level-up slots in order to take 
it as an option.STEP THREE 
DAMAGE THRESHOLDS
Increase all damage thresholds by 1.
STEP FOUR
DOMAIN CARDS
Acquire a new domain card at your level or lower from one of 
your classâs domains and add it to your loadout or vault. If your 
loadout is already full, you canât add the new card to it until 
you move another into your vault. You can also exchange one 
domain card youâve previously acquired for a different domain 
card of the same level or lower.
MULTICLASSING
Starting at level 5, you can choose multiclassing as an option 
when leveling up. When you multiclass, you choose an 
additional class, gain access to one of its domains, and acquire 
its class feature. Take the appropriate multiclass module and 
add it to the right side of your character sheet, then choose a 
foundation card from one of its subclasses. If your foundation 
cards specify different Spellcast traits, you can choose which 
one to apply when making a Spellcast roll.
Whenever you have the option to acquire a new domain card, 
you can choose from cards at or below half your current level 
(rounded up) from the domain you chose when you selected 
the multiclass advancement.

Daggerheart SRD

EQUIPMENT
Your equipped weapons and armor are the ones listed in 
the âActive Weaponsâ and âActive Armorâ sections of your 
character sheet. Your character can only attack with weapons, 
benefit from armor, and gain features from items they have 
equipped. You canât equip weapons or armor with a higher tier 
than you.
PCs can carry up to two additional weapons in the âInventory 
Weaponâ areas of the character sheet.
You can swap an Inventory Weapon with an Active Weapon of 
the same burden at no cost during a rest or moment of calm; 
otherwise, you must mark a Stress to do so.
Your character can only have one Active Armor at a time. 
They canât equip armor while in danger or under pressure; 
otherwise, they can equip or unequip armor without cost. 
Each armor has its own Armor Slots; if your character 
unequips their armor, track how many of its Armor Slots are 
marked. You can't carry armor in your inventory. When your 
character equips or unequips armor, recalculate your damage 
thresholds.WEAPONS
All weapons have a tier, trait, range, damage die, damage 
type, and burden. Some weapons also have a feature.
CATEGORY
A weaponâs category specifies whether it is a Primary or 
Secondary weapon. Your character can only equip up to one 
weapon of each category at a time.
TRAIT
A weaponâs trait specifies which trait to use when making an 
attack roll with it.
RANGE
A weaponâs range  specifies the maximum distance between 
the attacker and their target when attacking with it.
DAMAGE
A weaponâs damage indicates the size of the damage dice 
you roll on a successful attack with it; you roll a number of 
dice equal to your Proficiency. If the damage includes a flat 
modifier, this number is added to the total damage rolled, but 
is not altered or affected by Proficiency.
DAMAGE TYPE
A weaponâs damage type indicates whether it deals physical 
or magic damage. Weapons that deal magic damage can only 
be wielded by characters with a Spellcast trait.
BURDEN
A weaponâs burden indicates how many hands it occupies 
when equipped. Your characterâs maximum burden is 2 hands.
FEATURE
A weaponâs feature is a special rule that stays in effect while 
the weapon is equipped.
You can throw an equipped weapon at a target within Very 
Close range, making the attack roll with Finesse. On a 
success, deal damage as usual for that weapon. Once thrown, 
the weapon is no longer considered equipped. Until you 
retrieve and re-equip it, you canât attack with it or benefit from 
its features.

Combat Wheelchair
By Mark Thompson
The combat wheelchair is a ruleset designed to help you play a wheelchair user in Daggerheart. This section provides mechanics 
and narrative guidance for you to work from, but feel free to adapt the flavor text to best suit your character. Have fun with your 
characterâs wheelchair design, and make it as unique or tailored to them as you please.
ACTION AND MOVEMENT
When describing how your character moves, you can use 
descriptions such as the following:
â¢ âI roll over to the door to see if itâs open.â
â¢ âI wheel myself over to the group to ask whatâs going on.â
â¢ âI pull my brakes and skid to a halt, turning in my seat to 
level my bow at the intruder.â
CONSEQUENCES
Here are some ways you might describe complications you 
encounter when your character uses their wheelchair:
âI pull my brakes, but I donât think to account for the loose 
gravel on the ground.â
âI hit a patch of ice awkwardly and am sent skidding out 
past my target.â
âI go to push off in pursuit, but one of my front caster 
wheels snags on a crack in the pavement, stalling me for a 
moment.â
GMs should avoid breaking a character's wheelchair or 
otherwise removing it from play as a consequence, unless 
everyone at the table, especially the wheelchair userâs player, 
gives their approval.EVASION
Your character is assumed to be skilled in moving their 
wheelchair and navigating numerous situations in it. As a 
result, the only wheelchair that gives a penalty to a PC's 
Evasion is the Heavy Frame model.
BURDEN
All wheelchairs can be maneuvered using one or two hands 
outside of combat. However, when being used as a weapon, 
the chair is restricted to requiring one or two hands to 
perform attacks, depending on the model youâve chosen. If 
youâre playing a character who has limited to no mobility in 
their arms, their wheelchair can be attuned to them by magical 
means. For example, your character might use a psychic link 
to guide the chair around like a pseudo-electric wheelchair. All 
the rules presented here can be tailored and adapted to any 
character's needs.
CHOOSING YOUR MODEL
All combat wheelchairs are equipped as Primary Weapons. 
There are three models of wheelchair available: light, heavy, 
and arcane. Youâre encouraged to consider the type of 
character youâre playing and the class they belong to, then 
choose the model that best matches that character concept.
Light Frame Models
Though tough, these wheelchairs have light frames that allow the chair to move with your character in more acrobatic ways.  
These models are best suited to adventurers who rely on speed and flexibility.

Heavy Frame Models
These wheelchairs have bulky and heavier frames, allowing the chair to lend its weight to your characterâs attacks. It also makes 
them a bigger target.

Arcane Frame Models
These wheelchairs have frames that are attuned to your character and their magic, allowing them to channel their spells through 
the chair. Unlike other primary magic weapons, the arcane-frame model doesnât specify a trait to use when making an attack 
with it. Instead, you use the Spellcast trait indicated by your subclass.

ARMOR
Every armor has a name, base damage thresholds, and a base Armor Score. Some armor also has a feature.
â¢ An armorâs base armor score indicates how many Armor 
Slots it provides its wearer before additional bonuses are 
added to calculate their total Armor Score. A PCâs Armor 
Score canât exceed 12.
â¢ An armorâs base thresholds determine its wearerâs major 
and severe damage thresholds before adding bonuses to 
calculate their final damage thresholds.
â¢ An armorâs feature is a special rule that stays in effect 
while the armor is equipped.While unarmored, your characterâs base Armor Score is 0, 
their Major threshold is equal to their level, and their Severe 
threshold is equal to twice their level.
REDUCING INCOMING DAMAGE
When you take damage, you can mark one Armor Slot to 
reduce the number of Hit Points you would mark by one. If 
your character has an Armor Score of 0, you canât mark Armor 
Slots. If an effect temporarily increases your Armor Score, 
it increases your available Armor Slots by the same amount; 
when the effect ends, so does the availability of these Armor 
Slots.

Gold is an abstract measurement of how much wealth a 
character has, and is measured in handfuls, bags, and chests, 
with 10 handfuls to 1 bag, and 10 bags to 1 chest. When you 
have marked all of the slots in a category and you gain another 
gold reward in that category, mark a slot in the following 
category and clear all the slots in the current one. 
For example, if you have 9 handfuls and gain another, you 
instead mark 1 bag and erase all handfuls. If you have 9 bags 
and gain another, you mark 1 chest and erase all bags. 
You canât have more than 1 chest, so if all your Gold slots are 
marked, youâll need to spend some of your gold or store it 
somewhere else before you can acquire more.
Optional Rule: Gold Coins
If your group wants to track gold with more granularity, 
you can add coins as your lowest denomination. Following 
the established pattern, 10 coins equal 1 handful.

RUNNING AN ADVENTURE
INTRODUCTION
The GM is responsible for guiding the narrative and 
roleplaying the world the PCs inhabit. This section provides 
you with advice for running Daggerheart: using the core 
mechanics; creating memorable encounters; planning exciting 
sessions; selecting, creating, and using GM moves; crafting a 
full campaign; running dynamic NPCs; and more. 
GM GUIDANCE
These three sections provide a foundation to help you get the 
most out of this game. The âGM Principlesâ are your guiding 
starâwhen in doubt, return to these principles.
GM PRINCIPLES
BEGIN AND END WITH THE FICTION
Use the fiction to drive mechanics, then connect the mechanics 
back to the fiction.
COLLABORATE AT ALL TIMES, ESPECIALLY 
DURING CONFLICT
The PCs are the protagonists of the campaign; antagonism 
between player and GM should exist only in the fiction.  
FILL THE WORLD WITH LIFE, WONDER, AND 
DANGER
Showcase rich cultures, take the PCs to wondrous places, and 
introduce them to dangerous creatures.
ASK QUESTIONS AND INCORPORATE THE 
ANSWERS
Ensuring that the playersâ ideas are included results in a 
narrative that supports the whole groupâs creativity.
GIVE EVERY ROLL IMPACT
Only ask the players to roll during meaningful moments.
PLAY TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS
Be surprised by what the characters do, the choices they make, 
and the people they become.
HOLD ON GENTLY
Donât worry if you need to abandon or alter something that 
came before. GM PRACTICES
CULTIVATE A CURIOUS TABLE
Follow what catches the playersâ interest to foster an 
environment of creative inquiry.
GAIN YOUR PLAYERSâ TRUST
Act in good faith, follow through on your promises, admit your 
mistakes.
KEEP THE STORY MOVING FORWARD
Advance the story through escalating action, new information, 
or changing circumstances after every action roll, whether it 
succeeds or fails.
CUT TO THE ACTION
Skip past the boring bits. When a scene drags on, end it.
HELP THE PLAYERS USE THE GAME
Players have more fun when you help them understand the 
system.
CREATE A META CONVERSATION
Empower players to speak out of character, use safety tools, and 
ask for clarification.
TELL THEM WHAT THEY WOULD KNOW
Donât hide obvious details or important information from the 
players.
GROUND THE WORLD IN MOTIVE
An NPCâs actions flow from their goals and desires.
BRING THE GAMEâS MECHANICS TO LIFE
Set a good example of how fiction and mechanics work together 
to enhance the game experience.
REFRAME RATHER THAN REJECT
If a playerâs contribution conflicts with the fiction, work with 
them to reshape it.
WORK IN MOMENTS AND MONTAGES
When framing a scene, decide which beats should be savored 
and which shouldnât linger.
62
Daggerheart SRD

PITFALLS TO AVOID
UNDERMINING THE HEROES
If a roll doesnât go well, show how it was impacted by an 
adversaryâs prowess, environmental factors, or unexpected 
surprises, rather than the PCâs incompetence.
ALWAYS TELLING THE PLAYERS WHAT TO 
ROLL
Let the players decide how to handle a challenge.
LETTING SCENES DRAG
Shake it up or cut away when a scene has concluded, the 
tableâs energy is flagging, or people are talking in circles.
SINGULAR SOLUTIONS
Donât get hung up on one right answer to a problem. If the 
players have a clever idea, make it work.
Overplanning
Spend your prep time inventing situations instead of scripting 
scenes. If the players surprise you, take a break to think 
through your options. 
HOARDING FEAR
Spend Fear when you have the opportunity. The players will 
always generate more.
For more in-depth GM guidance, see pg. 140 of the 
Daggerheart Core Rulebook.
CORE GM MECHANICS
ROLLING DICE
The GM has no Duality Dice; instead, they roll a single d20 
called the GMâs Die.
ADVERSARY ATTACK ROLLS
When an adversary attacks a PC, roll your d20 and add the 
adversaryâs attack bonus to the result. If the total meets or 
beats the targetâs Evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, the 
attack fails. On a successful attack, roll the attackâs damage 
dice to determine how much it deals.
If you roll a natural 20 on an attack, your roll automatically 
succeeds and you deal extra damage. Roll damage normally, 
then add the highest number on the damage dice to the total. 
For example, an attack that deals 3d6+2 deals 18+3d6+2 on 
a critical success; the critical success does not affect the flat 
damage modifier. 
Note: a critical success on an adversaryâs reaction roll 
automatically succeeds, but confers no additional benefit.GUIDANCE ON ACTION ROLLS
After a player describes a move they want to make during 
the game, you might decide an action roll is necessary to 
determine how the scene progresses. Use this guide to 
determine what to present the player, choosing whichever 
option best fits the situation:
â¢ Determine whether the roll is necessary, considering the 
PCâs Experiences or backstory, the pressure theyâre acting 
under, and the possible outcomes. 
â¢ Establish the stakes of an action roll before the player 
makes it. 
â¢ Communicate any unavoidable consequences.
â¢ If desired, you can offer the player the opportunity to forgo 
an action roll in exchange for agreeing to an interesting 
outcome, cost, or complication.
MAKING MOVES
As the GM, you have GM moves that change the story in 
response to the playersâ actions. GM moves arenât bound by 
specific spells or effectsâwhen you make a GM move, you 
can describe the action in whatever way the fiction demands.
GM moves happen during GM turns. A GM turn begins when 
the spotlight passes to them and ends when the spotlight 
passes back to the players.
WHEN TO MAKE A MOVE
The GM can make a GM move whenever you want, but the 
frequency and severity depends on the type of story youâre 
telling, the actions your players take, and the tone of the 
session youâre running.
Make a GM move when the players:
â¢ Roll with Fear
â¢ Fail an action roll
â¢ Do something that has unavoidable consequences
â¢ Give you a âgolden opportunityâ (an opening that demands 
an immediate response)
â¢ Look to you for what happens next
CHOOSING GM MOVES
The result of a playerâs action roll determines your response:
On a Critical Success, you let the player describe their 
success, then give them an additional opportunity or 
advantage.
On a Success with Hope, you let the player describe their 
success, then you show how the world reacts to it.
On a Success with Fear, you work with the player to 
describe their success, then take a Fear and make a GM 
move to introduce a minor consequence, complication, or 
cost:
â¢ An adversary attacks
â¢ The PC marks a Stress
â¢ You introduce a new threat
â¢ You raise the stakes of the conflict

On a Failure with Hope, you describe how the PC fails to 
get what they want, then make a GM move to introduce a 
minor consequence, complication, or cost:
â¢ An adversary attacks
â¢ The PC marks a Stress
â¢ You introduce a new threat
â¢ You raise the stakes of the conflict
On a Failure with Fear, you describe how things go wrong, 
then make a GM move to introduce a major consequence, 
complication, or cost:
â¢ You put them in immediate danger
â¢ They become the focus of multiple adversaries
â¢ They are separated from their party
â¢ They lose an important opportunity for good.
QUICK REFERENCE:  
RESOLVING ACTION ROLLS
If youâre unsure how to resolve a roll, think about these quick 
phrases:
Success with Hope: Yes, andâ¦ (You get what you want and 
gain a Hope.)
Success with Fear: Yes, butâ¦ (You get what you want, but 
thereâs a consequence, and the GM gains a Fear.)
Failure with Hope: No, butâ¦ (Things donât go as planned, 
but you gain a Hope.)
Failure with Fear: No, andâ¦ (Things donât go as planned 
and it gets worse. The GM gains a Fear.)
If the move you should make is not obvious from the fiction, 
draw inspiration from the âExample GM Movesâ list:
â¢ Introduce a new obstacle or enemy
â¢ Ask the player what happens
â¢ Have the PC mark a Stress
â¢ T ell the players âeverything is fineâ¦ for now.â
SOFT AND HARD MOVES
Soft moves go easier on the playersâthey give the party new 
information about the scene and offer them an opportunity to 
react to it. Hard moves are harsher, more impactful, or more 
directâthe PCs donât get an opening to interrupt, alter, or 
anticipate the outcome.
Use softer moves on rolls with Hope and harder moves on 
rolls with Fear.Example GM Moves
â¢ Show how the world reacts
â¢ Ask a question and build on the answer
â¢ Make an NPC act in accordance with their motive
â¢ Drive a PC to take action by dangling their goals in 
front of them
â¢ Signal an imminent off-screen threat
â¢ Reveal an unwelcome truth or unexpected danger
â¢ Force the group to split up
â¢ Make a PC mark Stress
â¢ Make a move the characters donât see
â¢ Show the collateral damage
â¢ Clear an adversaryâs condition
â¢ Shift the environment
â¢ Spotlight an adversary
â¢ Capture someone or something important
â¢ Use a PCâs backstory against them
â¢ Take away an opportunity permanently.
USING FEAR
You start a campaign with 1 Fear per PC in the party. 
You gain Fear whenever a PC rolls with Fear, the PCs take a 
rest (see: Downtime), or when an ability or effect tells you to.
You can never have more than 12 Fear at one time.
Fear carries over between sessions.
Spend a Fear to:
â¢ Interrupt the players to steal the spotlight and make a 
move
â¢ Make an additional GM move
â¢ Use an adversaryâs Fear Feature
â¢ Use an environmentâs Fear Feature
â¢ Add an adversaryâs Experience to a roll

Daggerheart SRD

The dramatic tension of a scene correlates with the amount of 
Fear you spend during it. For guidance on how much Fear you 
should spend in a scene, consult the following table:
Incidental A catch-up between PCs 
after an emotionally charged 
scene; gathering information; 
resupplying at a local market; 
resting during downtime.0â1 Fear
Minor A travel sequence; a minor 
skirmish that introduces new 
foes or signals future trouble.1â3 Fear
Standard A substantial battle with a 
notable objective; perilous 
travel that tests might and 
wit; a tense social encounter 
seeking crucial information 
or aid.2â4 Fear
Major A large battle with a Solo 
or Leader adversary; a 
character-defining scene 
with a significant change to 
a characterâs personal story 
(such as revelation, growth, 
and betrayal).4â8 Fear
Climactic A major confrontation with 
the villain of a story arc; 
an epic set piece battle; a 
judicial duel to determine an 
important NPCâs fate.6â12 FearIf you find yourself with a large amount of Fear, consider:
â¢ Spending Fast: Spend Fear before the players have a 
chance to react
â¢ Spending Often: Spend Fear every time the spotlight 
swings to you
â¢ Spending Big: Spend Fear to make multiple moves in a row
Spending Fear to make a move communicates the increased 
impact of your action. Fear moves often include one or more 
of these elements:
â¢ Introducing new adversaries to a scene when their 
appearance hasnât been foreshadowed or lacks context.
â¢ An adversary activating a powerful spell or transformation 
to deal massive damage or boost their capabilities.
â¢ An environment exerting a strong negative effect on the 
party.
DIFFICULTY BENCHMARKS
The Difficulty of an attack roll against an adversary is equal 
to the adversaryâs Difficulty score. The Difficulty of any other 
action rolls against an adversary is equal to the adversaryâs 
Difficulty score, plus (if applicable) the value of one of the 
adversary relevant Experience modifiers. When a player makes an action roll without a specified 
Difficulty, the GM sets the Difficulty according to the totality 
of the circumstances. Refer to the following benchmark table 
for more guidance:
 AGILITY roll sprint leap Maneuver
5 Sprint within Close range across an 
open field with an enemy present.Make a running jump of half your height 
(about 3 feet for a human).Walk slowly across a narrow beam.
10 Sprint within Far range across an open 
field with an enemy present.Make a running jump of your height 
(about 6 feet for a human).Walk quickly across a narrow beam.
15 Sprint within Close range across 
rough terrain with an enemy present.Make a running jump of double your 
height (about 12 feet for a human).Run across a narrow beam.
20 Sprint within Close range through an 
active battle of multiple enemies.Make a running jump of three times your 
height (about 18 feet for a human).Run across a narrow beam in heavy 
wind.
25 Sprint within Far range through a 
pitched battle in rough terrain.Make a running jump of five times your 
height (about 30 feet for a human).Run across a very narrow beam in 
an active rainstorm.
30 Sprint across the heads of your 
enemies in a pitched battle.Make a running jump of ten times your 
height (about 60 feet for a human).Run across an inch-wide, oil-slicked 
beam in an active rainstorm.

GIVING ADVANTAGE AND 
DISADVANTAGE
T o viscerally convey how a PCâs actions or circumstances 
affect their ability to act, grant them advantage die (or impose 
disadvantage die) instead of adjusting the Difficulty of an 
action roll.
ADVERSARY ACTION ROLLS
By default, adversaries donât normally make action rolls except 
for attack rolls and any unique actions described in their 
stat blocks. Any other action an adversary attempts simply 
succeeds without an action roll; if you want an adversaryâs 
action to have a chance of failure, have any relevant PCs make 
reaction rolls instead. 
However, for especially dramatic or difficult tasks that the 
PCs canât influence, you can give an adversary an action roll 
anyway. For an adversaryâs action roll, roll a d20. If the result 
is equal to or greater than the actionâs Difficulty, the action 
succeedsâotherwise it fails. You can spend a Fear before 
rolling to add a relevant Experience from the adversaryâs stat 
block to the total. Use the same procedure when an adversary 
makes a reaction roll.ADVERSARY ADVANTAGE & DISADVANTAGE
If an adversary has advantage on an action roll, the GM rolls 
an extra d20 and counts only the higher result. If an adversary 
has disadvantage on an action roll, the GM rolls an extra d20 
and counts only the lower result.
ADVERSARY ATTACKS
When an adversary attacks a PC, the GM rolls a d20 and adds 
the adversaryâs Attack Modifier to the result. If the total meets 
or beats the targetâs Evasion, the attack succeeds; otherwise, 
it fails. Before rolling, the GM can grant the attacking 
adversary advantage, impose disadvantage, or spend a Fear to 
add a relevant Experience from the adversaryâs stat block to 
the total.
On a success, the adversary deals the damage listed in their 
stat block to the target. 
When an adversaryâs action lets the GM make an attack 
against multiple targets, they make one attack roll and 
compare it to each targetâs Evasion separately.

COUNTDOWNS
Countdowns represent a period of time or series of events 
preceding a future effect. A countdown begins at a starting 
value. When a countdown advances, itâs reduced by 1. The 
countdownâs effect is triggered when the countdown reaches 
0. 
Note: You can track countdowns by âspinning downâ dice or 
ticking off boxes.
Standard countdowns advance every time a player makes an 
action roll. If an adversary or environment ability refers to a 
âCountdown [n],â then it means a standard countdown with a 
starting value of n. 
Dynamic countdowns advance by up to 3 depending on 
the outcomes of action rolls. Consequence countdowns 
are dynamic countdowns to negative effects. Progress 
countdowns are dynamic countdowns to positive effects. 
Dynamic countdowns advance according to this chart:
DYNAMIC COUNTDOWN

Failure with Hope No advancement Tick down 2
Success with Fear Tick down 1 Tick down 1

ADVANCED COUNTDOWN 
FEATURES
â¢ Countdowns with randomized starting values
â¢ Loop countdowns that reset to their starting value after 
their countdown effect is triggered.
â¢ Increasing countdowns that increase their starting value 
by 1 every time they loop.
â¢ Decreasing countdowns that decrease their starting value 
by 1 every time they loop.
â¢ Linked progress and consequence countdowns that 
simultaneously advance according to the same action roll 
outcomes.
â¢ Long-term countdowns that advance after rests instead 
of action rolls.
GIVING OUT GOLD,  
EQUIPMENT, AND LOOT
Itâs up to you and your players how much importance you want 
to place on gold, equipment, and loot in your campaign. 
Adjust the availability and utility of wealth and equipment to 
reflect the tone, themes, and setting of your campaign.
If you donât wish to track gold, then when PCs go shopping for 
new items let them pick one or two from a short, preselected list that aligns with your campaign setting and the partyâs 
current location.
Otherwise, set the prices of goods and services by adjusting 
the entries in the Average Costs table to reflect your campaign 
setting:
Meals for a party of adventurers per 
night1 Handful
Standard inn room per night 1 Handful
Luxury inn room per night 1 Bag
Carriage ride 2 Handfuls
Mount (horse, mule, etc.) 3 Bags
Specialized tools 3 Handfuls
Fine clothing 3 Handfuls
Luxury clothing 1 Bag
Tier 1 equipment (weapons, armor) 1â5 Handfuls
Tier 2 equipment (weapons, armor) 1â2 Bags
Tier 3 equipment (weapons, armor) 5â10 Bags
Tier 4 equipment (weapons, armor) 1â2 Chests
RUNNING GM NPCS
When you run NPCs as the GM, you should always strive to 
follow your GM principles and use them to bring the world to 
life. Differentiate NPCs with unique manners of speech and 
action; let their individual goals and desires motivate their 
actions.
The only essential elements for a NPC are their name, 
description, and motive. If itâs likely that the PCs will roll 
actions against them, give them a Difficulty. Adversaries 
can be invented or improvised by modifying the stat block of 
another adversary.
If an NPC becomes an ally in combat, they donât need a stat 
blockâjust put the spotlight on what they do and show how 
their involvement alters the fiction. If a PC capitalizes on their 
help during the scene, give the PC advantage. NPCs that donât 
have Hit Points or Stress can still be injured or killed if the 
fiction demands it.
If you want an important NPC to mechanically interact with 
the system, you can give them one or more features with 
specific triggers and effects. An NPC might also have a choice 
that adjusts the parameters of their feature. For example:
ARCANE HOLD
Choice: When the battle begins, choose a favored PC.
Trigger: The first time during a battle the favored PC is 
within Close range and hit with an attack.
Effect: Make an attack roll with a +6 modifier against 
the adversary. On a success, the target is temporarily 
Restrained by tendrils of powerful magic.
68
Daggerheart SRD

NPC FEATURE EXAMPLES
VOLLEY OF ARROWS
Trigger: A battle begins and this NPC is involved.
Effect: Activate a countdown (Loop 3). It ticks down when 
a PC misses an attack. When it triggers, this NPC releases 
a volley of arrows at a target of the PCsâ choice, dealing 
2d8+3 physical damage.
MENTOR
  Choice: When the battle begins, choose a protÃ©gÃ© PC.
Trigger: Your protÃ©gÃ© is within Close range and fails an 
attack roll.
Effect: Move into Melee range with the PC and give them 
advice or guidance. The next attack roll they make has 
advantage.
REGROUP
  Choice: When a battle begins, choose a point within Far 
range.
Trigger: All PCs have marked all of their Armor Slots.
Effect: T eleport all PCs and this NPC to the chosen spot 
and clear an Armor Slot on each target.
INTO THE NIGHT
Trigger: The PCs start a long rest with this NPC.
Effect: Roll 1d4. On a 2 or less, this NPC steals 1 handful 
of gold from the party while they are sleeping, then 
disappears into the night.
OPTIONAL GM MECHANICS
FATE ROLLS
When the GM wants to leave an outcome entirely up to 
chance, they call for a fate roll. The GM establishes whatâs at 
stake and how the roll will be interpreted. Then a player rolls 
one of their Duality Dice and interprets the result. 
Examples:
âRoll your Fear Die. On a 4 or lower, the fire spreads beyond 
this house.â
âI think itâs really up to chance whether reinforcements will 
make it to you in time. Go ahead and roll your Fear Dieâ
thatâll determine the starting size of the countdown. When 
that triggers, reinforcements will arrive in your Far range.â
âGo ahead and roll your Hope Die to see how big the crowd 
at the inn is tonight. The higher the roll, the bigger the 
crowd.â
âMake a roll using your Hope Die to determine the number 
of Stamina Potions the shop has in stock.âFALLING AND COLLISION DAMAGE
If a character falls to the ground, you can use the following as 
a guide to determine the damage they take:
â¢ A fall from Very Close range deals 1d10+3 physical 
damage.
â¢ A fall from Close range deals 1d20+5 physical damage.
â¢ A fall from Far or Very Far range deals 1d100+15 physical 
damage, or death at the GMâs discretion.
If a character collides with an object or another character at a 
dangerous speed, they take 1d20+5 direct physical damage.
MOVING AND FIGHTING UNDERWATER
By default, attack rolls made while the attacker is underwater 
have disadvantage.
For creatures that canât breathe underwater, use a standard 
countdown (3) to track how long they can hold their breath. 
Advance the countdown whenever the PC takes an action. In 
addition if they fail a roll or roll with Fear while underwater, 
you can spend your GM move to advance it an additional 
timeâor twice, if they rolled a failure with Fear.
Once the countdown ends, the underwater PC must mark a 
Stress whenever they take an action.
CONFLICT BETWEEN PCS
Sometimes a player might want their character to act against 
another PC in the scene. Before jumping to rolling dice, 
discuss the situation with both players to decide how to 
resolve the conflict. A roll might not be necessary to reach 
an outcomeâbut if rolling will be fun for everyone involved, 
come to a consensus on the terms of the roll, then facilitate 
the scene according to the results. 
On an attack roll against a PC, the attacker rolls against the 
defenderâs Evasion, just like an adversary. On any other kind 
of action roll, the instigator makes an action roll and the target 
makes a reaction roll. T o succeed, the instigator must beat a 
Difficulty equal to the total value of the reaction roll.

ADVERSARIES AND 
ENVIRONMENTS
USING ADVERSARIES
ADVERSARY STAT BLOCKS
All the information required to run an adversary is contained 
in their stat block. An adversaryâs stat block includes their: 
NAME
Each stat block has a unique name. Abilities that affect 
adversaries with a certain name include all adversaries who 
use that stat block, regardless of their in-story name.
TIER
Each adversary is designed to oppose PCs of a certain tier. If 
you confront the party with an adversary from another tier, 
adjust their stats.
TYPE
The adversaryâs type appears alongside their tier. An 
adversaryâs type represents the role they play in a conflict. 
The adversary types are:
â¢ Bruisers: tough; deliver powerful attacks.
â¢ Hordes: groups of identical creatures acting together as a 
single unit.
â¢ Leaders: command and summon other adversaries.
â¢ Minions: easily dispatched but dangerous in numbers.
â¢ Ranged: fragile in close encounters but deal high damage 
at range.
â¢ Skulks: maneuver and exploit opportunities to ambush 
opponents.
â¢ Socials: present challenges around conversation instead 
of combat.
â¢ Solos: present a formidable challenge to a whole party, 
with or without support.
â¢ Standards: representative of their fictional group.
â¢ Supports: enhance their allies and disrupt their 
opponents.
DESCRIPTION
MOTIVES & TACTICS
DIFFICULTY
The Difficulty of any roll made against the adversary, unless 
otherwise noted.
DAMAGE THRESHOLDS, HIT POINTS,  
AND STRESS
These systems function the same way they do for PCs. The 
numbers listed after âThresholdâ are the adversaryâs Major 
and Severe Thresholds.ATTACK MODIFIER
When you attack with the adversary, apply this bonus or 
penalty to your attack roll.
STANDARD ATTACK
A description of the adversaryâs primary mode of inflicting 
harm on the PCs. It includes the attackâs name, its effective 
range, and the damage it deals on a success. Using an 
adversaryâs standard attack is a GM move.
EXPERIENCE (OPTIONAL)
The GM can spend a Fear to add an adversaryâs relevant 
Experience to raise their attack roll or increase the Difficulty of 
a roll made against them.
EXAMPLE EXPERIENCES:
Acrobatics Hunt from Above Navigation
Ambusher Intimidation Nobility
Bartering Intrusion Quick Reflexes
Blademaster Keen Senses Socialite
Bodyguard Magical 
KnowledgeStealth
Commander Natureâs Friend Tracker
FEATURE(S)
There are three kinds of adversary features: actions, 
reactions, and passives. Note: each adversaries stress 
is tracked individually. If a feature requires the GM to 
spend Stress to activate it, the Stress must come from the 
adversary whose feature is being activate. If a feature has a 
Fear requirement, it must be spent in addition to any Fear 
already spentâfor instance, to interrupt the PCs and put the 
spotlight on the adversary.
â¢ Actions: a special attack or other unique action that the 
adversary can perform when the spotlight is on them.
â¢ Reactions: special effects that take effect when their 
trigger occurs, regardless of whether the spotlight is on 
the adversary.
â¢ Passives: special abilities that remain in effect by default 
and require no resources or triggers to activate.
FEAR FEATURE(S)
High-impact effects that cost a Fear to activate.

When planning a battle, start with [(3 x the number of 
PCs in combat) + 2] Battle Points and make the following 
adjustments:
-1 for an easier or shorter fight
-2 if youâre using 2 or more Solo adversaries
-2 if you add +1d4 (or a static +2) to all adversariesâ 
damage rolls
+1 if you choose an adversary from a lower tier
+1 if you donât include any Bruisers, Hordes, Leaders, or 
Solos
+2 for a harder or longer fight
Then spend your Battle Points to add an adversary to the 
encounter:
Spend 1 point for each group of Minions equal to the size 
of the party.
Spend 1 point for each Social or Support adversary.
Spend 2 points for each Horde, Ranged, Skulk, or Standard 
adversary.
Spend 3 points for each Leader adversary.
Spend 4 points for each Bruiser adversary.
Spend 5 points for each Solo adversary.
DEFEATED ADVERSARIES
When an adversary marks their last Hit Point, they are 
defeated: incapacitated, tied up, routed, killed, or anything 
else the table decides makes sense.

USING ENVIRONMENTS
Environments represent everything in a scene beyond the PCs and adversaries, such as the physical space, background NPCs, and 
natural forces. 
ENVIRONMENT STAT BLOCK
Each environmentâs stat block presents their necessary 
mechanical statistics:
NAME 
TIER
Their PC tier the environment is designed to challenge.
TYPE
The type of scene it most easily supports:
â¢ Explorations â wondrous locations with mysteries and 
marvels to discover
â¢ Socials â locations that primarily present interpersonal 
challenges
â¢ Traversals â dangerous locations where movement 
through and around the space itself is a challenge
â¢ Events â special activities or occurrences (rather than 
physical spaces) DESCRIPTION
An evocative one-line summary of the environment.
IMPULSES
The manner or mode with which the environment pushs and 
pulls the people within them.
DIFFICULTY
The standard Difficulty for action rolls made to overcome, 
oppose, or resist the environment or its elements.
POTENTIAL ADVERSARIES
FEATURES
FEATURE QUESTIONS
Prompts for plot hooks, narrative engines, and connections to 
other story elements.
ADAPTING ENVIRONMENTS
Sometimes you want to use an environment but itâs at the 
wrong tier for your party. Or you might want to replace 
a feature or two, then present it as an entirely different 
environment. Whether planning your session or even 
improvising an environment mid-session, you can adjust an 
existing environmentâs stat block to fit the needs of your 
scene or improvise elements as needed. The environments framework is there to help organize ideas, not to stifle 
creativity.
When you need to quickly adjust a stat block to a different 
tier, you can simply replace its existing statistics with those 
listed on the Environment Statistics by Tier table, using the 
column that corresponds to your partyâs tier.

ADDITIONAL GM GUIDANCE
This section provides additional guidance for preparing and 
running a session of Daggerheart. 
STORY BEATS
In storytelling, a beat is a moment that changes the trajectory 
of the narrativeâa shift in the world, a significant action or 
reaction, an emotional revelation, or an important decision. 
Take turns with the players, narrating a beat and then letting 
them react and carry the scene forward with their own beats. 
When preparing for a session, plan in terms of the moments 
that give shape to each scene or sequence, rather than pre-
scripting specific details or exchanges.
PREPARING COMBAT 
ENCOUNTERS
Build the hurdles the PCs face around the question of âWhat 
helps tell the story?â Enemies, environments, and hazards are 
the tools for heightening tension and creating drama. Ensure 
that combat is being used to give players more information 
about the unfolding story, revealing the world, the plot, or the 
characters. 
BATTLES AND NARRATIVE
Dynamic battles create suspense by forcing players to choose 
between their various objectives, engaging their characterâs 
motivations and weaknesses, and creating the crucible that 
the players use to forge their characters into legendary 
heroes. When preparing combat encounters:
â¢ Consider the narrative function of the battle
â¢ Base adversariesâ moves on their motives
â¢ Use dynamic environments to bring the battleground to 
life
â¢ Add enemies that can interact with the PCsâ features and 
special abilities
SESSION REWARDS
Reward players at the end of a session with:
â¢ Useful information
â¢ Story hooks
â¢ Loot 
â¢ Gold
â¢ Access to new equipment or enhancements
CRAFTING SCENES
Whenever you start a session, arrive at a new place, or change 
the situation, tell the players what they need to know by 
thinking with all of your senses and sharing something unique 
or unexpected about the fiction.ENGAGING YOUR PLAYERS
Keep your players engaged by:
â¢ Rotating the Focus between the PCs
â¢ Tying T ogether Story Elements
â¢ Engaging Quiet Players
â¢ Using Visual Aids
â¢ Encouraging Unguided Play
â¢ Confronting the PCs with internal and external conflicts
â¢ Raise the Stakes by Spending Fear
â¢ Layering Goals Other than Attrition into Combat (see Table 
of Random Objectives on the next page)
1d12 Objective
1 Acquire (obtain or steal) an important item or 
items.
2 Capture one or more of the opponents.
3 Activate a magical device.
4 Frame a character or tarnish their reputation.
5 Drive the opponent into a corner or ambush point.
6 Stop a magical ritual, legal ceremony, or time-
sensitive spell.
7 Hold the lineâkeep the enemy from reaching a 
specific area or group.
8 Plant evidence or a tracking device on a target.
9 Secure a specific location ahead of another groupâs 
arrival.
10 Harass the opponent to deplete their resources or 
keep them occupied.
11 Destroy a piece of architecture, a statue, a shrine, 
or a weapon.
12 Investigate a situation to confirm or deny existing 
information.
PHASED BATTLES
Make battles by shifting the nature of its enemies or 
environment mid-combat:
â¢ Change the T erms of Engagement
â¢ Alter the Environment
â¢ Evolve the Opposition 
USING DOWNTIME
Use downtime scenes as a pressure release valve to vary the 
intensity of the story and give the PCs room to breathe.
Empower your players to frame their own downtime scenes. 
Ask the players what it looks like as they tend to their wounds 
or unwind together, encouraging them to take the reins and 
work with other players whose characters are involved
112
Daggerheart SRD

PROJECTS DURING DOWNTIME
The Work on a Project downtime move requires more GM 
input than other downtime moves and is best suited for long-
term endeavors the PCs wish to undertake.
These projects are typically tracked using a Progress 
Countdown. When deciding the starting value of the 
countdown, consider the complexity of the project, the 
availability of relevant tools, and the impact of the project on 
the story.
Simple projects advance their countdown each time a player 
uses the Work on a Project move, but complex projects 
require a roll.
EXTENDED DOWNTIME
When you fast-forward the story across an extended period, 
use montages to illustrate the passage of time. You gain 
1d6 Fear per PC and advance any long-term countdowns as 
appropriate.
CAMPAIGN FRAMES
A campaign frame provides inspiration, tools, and mechanics 
to support a particular type of story at the table.
Every campaign frame has a complexity rating that indicates 
how much its mechanics deviate from or expand upon the 
Daggerheart core ruleset.
Each campaign frame includes the following sections.
â¢ A pitch to present to players
â¢ Suggestions and guidance on tone, feel, themes, and 
touchstones
â¢ An overview of the campaignâs background
â¢ Guidance for fitting communities, ancestries, and classes 
into the setting
â¢ Principles for players and GMs to focus on during the 
campaign
â¢ Unique setting distinctions
â¢ An inciting incident to launch the campaign
â¢ Special mechanics to use during the campaign
â¢ Questions to consider during session zero

THE PITCH
Read this section to your players to introduce them to the 
campaign.
Fanewick was once a place of great abundance and 
peaceâdangerous to those unfamiliar with the land, but a 
cornucopia to those who respected its ways. When Haven 
invaded the wilds and forced the land into eternal spring, a 
dangerous bloom known as the Witherwild took hold and 
now threatens the lives of all who live there. In a Witherwild 
campaign, youâll play unlikely heroes from humble 
beginnings who are reckoning with their newfound duty to 
save Fanewickâs people from dangerous corruption.

OVERVIEW
If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the 
following information before character creation.
Fanewick is a wild and untamed land, long avoided by outside 
forces. The woods are dark and twisting, filled with Faint 
Divinities who perform small miracles and services for its 
inhabitants, but are just as likely to lure travelers off narrow 
paths to their ruin. Seemingly harmless expanses of field hide 
bogs that engulf entire armies, consuming heavy artillery as 
quickly as it can cross the border. This wilderness fosters 
hardy people who are bold enough to raise families where 
others have not and strictly follow the unique rules that keep 
them safe. These Wicklings remained insulated from their 
neighborsâ wars until plague forced the people of Haven to 
desperate acts.
Haven  was once the most powerful force in the region; for 
centuries, the high stone walls into the capital bore the phrase 
âThe Godless Gate.â While the original meaning has been 
113
Daggerheart SRD

lost to common knowledge, some dusty tomes and ancient 
records state that the founders of Haven wished to be free 
of the influence of the Faint Divinities that dominated the 
surrounding regions. They hatched a plan to kill one of the 
mightiest of these deities, known as ShunâAush the Granite 
Ophid. While their exact method of deicide is forgotten, their 
victory ensured Havenâs dominance in the region for centuries 
to come. They made their home behind his remains, which 
became the mighty walls that Haven is known for. 
But ShunâAush would have his revenge. As the Havenites 
carved through his stone body, the fine dust left behind 
settled into the surrounding earth. There was a time of 
prosperity over many centuries while the scales of the god 
remained undisturbed. But progress is its own pressure. The 
growing population demanded increased productivity, and 
as farmers tilled deeper soil and miners hacked into hidden 
stone, the ancient stone dust rose to the surface. The same 
walls that brought the city security became the crucible that 
incubated a virulent plague. 
Over the last two years, over half of Havenâs populace fell to a 
disease known as the Serpentâs Sickness. First, victims cough 
up dust. Soon after, their skin breaks out in a scaling rash. 
Finally, their body hardensâfirst the flesh, bones, and soft 
tissue, spreading until, finally, their organs ossify. Once within 
the organs, âthe serpentâ moves so quickly that sufferers 
petrify where they stand, filling Haven with statues of victims 
in their last moments of agony.
The High Magus of Haven, Archmage Phylax, discovered a 
rare red flower called the crimson ladyâs veil that could cure 
the Serpentâs Sickness. These buds grow prolifically across 
Fanewick in the springâbut for every ten thousand of the 
common white-petaled blossoms, only one red flower blooms.
Desperate to save their people from the plague, Haven 
invaded Fanewick to amass the scarce red buds. Their forces 
plunged into the deep wood and, under the guidance of 
Archmage Phylax, plucked out the Reaping Eye from the most 
powerful Faint Divinity that protected the land: The Great 
Owl Nikta, the Shepherd of the Seasons. The Shepherd kept 
Fanewick in balance by turning her eyes upon the land, first 
for ripening, then ruination. Thus Nikta maintained the cycle 
of seasonsâof growth and decay, of death and rebirth. With 
her Reaping Eye removed, Nikta can only watch over Fanewick 
with the Sowing Eye, forcing the land into everlasting spring. 
In the year since, Haven has conquered the bogs, turning them 
into fields to harvest red flowers. The endless growth that 
once seemed like a gift quickly evolved into a scourge known 
as the WitherwildâFanewickâs flora and fauna flourished, 
unchecked and uncontrolled. Animals swell to massive size; 
trees warp, twist, and begin to hunt people; and vines creep 
along the forest floor, strangling all they touch. This explosive 
growth is unconquerable and unrelenting, with no force able 
to stop the burgeoning verdance for long. 
Prior to the Serpentâs Sickness and the Shepherdâs endless 
growth, your party lived a peaceful life in Fanewick or a life of 
toil and conquest in Haven. But when the danger demands a 
response, even the unpreparedâand unwillingâmust make 
a stand.COMMUNITIES
All communities are available, but some have unique aspects 
within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following 
information to your players and choose one or more of the 
questions to ask them during your session zero.
LOREBORNE AND HIGHBORNE
In Fanewick, knowledge is the most valuable commodity, and 
those who have expertise have the most power. This economy 
of information functions primarily through gifting and trading, 
and wisdom would be considered acceptable collateral for 
a weapon or warm meal. As such, loreborne community 
members are the wealthiest in Fanewick and might be smaller, 
distinct groups of hunters, historians, or artisans within larger 
villages.
What knowledge did your community teach you that you 
must now protect or share?
What are you able to accomplish because of your upbringing 
that others outside your community do not understand?
You once traded important knowledge for something terrible. 
What did you impart and what did you gain in return?  
In Haven, the wealthiest members are highborne, having 
inherited riches built in the walled city over generations. 
While the highborne of Haven were more insulated from the 
Serpentâs Sickness, none were immune.
Who have you lost to the Serpentâs Sickness? How did it 
affect you?
How did your family make their wealth? Have you rejected 
or embraced their core set of ethics?
You grew up in a world of abundance but were kept from 
learning something about the world. What was this 
knowledge and when did you discover it?
RIDGEBORNE, UNDERBORNE,  
AND WILDBORNE
Characters from these communities were likely raised in 
Fanewickâs deadly environs, which have only become more 
dangerous as the Witherwild grows. Each community has 
unique customs, some freely shared and others kept secret, 
that allow them safe passage through dangerous terrain and 
the Faint Divinitiesâ territories.  
In exchange for protection from the Witherwild for themselves 
and their families, some Wicklings from these groups have 
been forced to take jobs as farmers in Havenâs flower fields. 
Though it is backbreaking work performed for a nation 
destroying their land, the farmers are offered safety by the 
Haven fires that burn back the ever-creeping Witherwild.
114
Daggerheart SRD

What Faint Divinities do you give tribute to, and how have 
you been rewarded in kind?
You displeased a god of Fanewick. What did you do, and 
what misfortune befell you or a loved one?
You fled the place of your birth. What circumstances drove 
you to leave?
ORDERBORNE
Players might choose to build orderborne characters if they 
want to play current or former members of the Haven Army 
that invaded Fanewick. Though the army brings violence into 
this land, they also carry overwhelming grief for a homeland 
succumbing to disease.
What regrets do you carry with you from your conquest of 
foreign soil?
What kindness did an enemy combatant bestow upon you 
in an hour of need? How did this change your view of the 
people of Fanewick?
You were charged with planting a rumor in a Fanewick 
community. What is the rumor, and do you plan to carry 
out this mission?
SLYBORNE
As the Haven Army is the current martial power in Fanewick, 
those who wish to play slyborne characters might come 
from Fanewick rebel groups seeking to expel the invading 
forces from their lands. Depending on the tactics their group 
employs, a character from a slyborne community might align 
with or go against their upbringing.
Who among the Haven Army do you wish to exact revenge 
upon and why?
You joined an insurgent group working to free this land 
from Havenâs grasp. What has given you doubts about the 
leadershipâs methods?
Someone you love is a member of the Haven Army. How 
have you used your position in the rebellion to protect them?
SEABORNE
Both Fanewick and Haven have a coastal border. The majority 
of Fanewickâs seaborne communities live in small seaside 
groups and focus on local travel to neighboring regions, while 
Havenites tend to live in large ports that ship and receive 
goods from distant lands.You recently traveled by sea over a vast distance. What 
went terribly wrong on that passage, and how has it 
changed you?
Growing up on the sea taught you a skill few have. What did 
you learn, and how did it save your life?
You used to sail with a companion. Who were they, and 
how do you remain connected?
WANDERBORNE
Wanderborne communities can be found in both Fanewick and 
Haven, though safe travel has been severely restricted due to 
the military occupation and the expansion of the Witherwild. 
Whether a wanderborne character comes from Fanewick, 
Haven, or elsewhere, the player should determine their 
characterâs personal views on the invasion of Fanewick, and 
how that aligns or departs from their communityâs views.
What do you do to keep your small community safe, 
independent, and hidden from Havenâs forces?
Because of your communityâs transience, you have loved 
ones in both Fanewick and Haven. How has this affected 
your relationship with the invasion?
Your community travels to protect something. What is it, 
and why does it keep you from settling down?
ANCESTRIES
All ancestries are available, but some have unique aspects 
within a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following 
information to your players.
CLANKS
Clanks from Haven are commonly made from iron and steel, 
while clanks from Fanewick are typically constructed from 
wood and stone.
FUNGRIL
Since the Witherwild spread throughout Fanewick, some 
fungril inhabiting the forests have grown noticeably larger than 
fungril from other regions.
DRAKONA, FAUNS, FIRBOLGS, AND INFERNIS
After the Witherwild corrupted Fanewick, some drakona, 
fauns, firbolgs, and infernis have noticed their horns growing 
faster and longer.
GALAPA AND RIBBETS
Many families of galapa and ribbets who lived in the bogs of 
Fanewick were displaced when Havenâs army invaded.
Havenites and the Serpentâs Sickness
Anyone, but especially those from Haven, may carry the 
Serpentâs Sickness, which stiffens their movements and gives 
them limited time to survive without a cure.
115
Daggerheart SRD

CLASSES
All classes are available, but some have unique aspects within 
a Witherwild campaign. As needed, provide the following 
information to your players.
Druids, Rangers, and Sorcerers
Druids, rangers, and sorcerers are commonly found 
throughout Fanewick. If players choose one of these classes, 
they should consider how their characterâs connection to the 
natural world might be impacted by the Witherwild.
WARRIORS AND WIZARDS
Warriors and wizards are prevalent in Haven. A large wizarding 
school in Haven teaches fighters and healers, and the Haven 
Army is largely composed of warriors and School of War 
wizards. If a PC is either of these classes, consider their 
personal relationship to the Haven Army.
VENGEANCE GUARDIAN
Many Wicklings who seek revenge on Haven or to expel them 
from Fanewick become Vengeance guardians. If players 
choose this subclass, they should consider what ideals or 
institutions their character protects.
SYNDICATE ROGUE
The Haven Army sends spies into Fanewick communities to 
gain information on planned attacks and manipulate public 
perception. When selecting the Syndicate rogue subclass, 
players should consider how their character might be 
connected to or impacted by these covert operatives.
PLAYER PRINCIPLES
If your group decides to play this campaign, give your players the 
following information before character creation.
MAKE THE INVASION PERSONAL
Consider how Havenâs invasion of Fanewick deeply impacts 
your character. Let these details inform what they want and 
what theyâre willing to do to get it. Everyone has lost a loved 
one to the Witherwild or the Serpentâs Sickness, and more 
are dying by the day. Consider how the growing conflict 
caused your character to act in ways they arenât proud of, 
or transformed personal truths they once believed were 
unshakable.
TREAT DEATH WITH IMPORTANCE
Taking a life should not be done without consideration, 
desperation, and consequences. As your character journeys, 
they should remember those theyâve lost and those theyâve 
slain, allowing each death to affect their choices in the future. 
EMBRACE VULNERABILITY
Find your characterâs humanity and showcase it whenever you 
can. They should be as vulnerable during quiet moments as 
they are vicious during violent ones, opening up to their allies 
even if they close themself off to everyone else.GM PRINCIPLES
Keep the following guidance in mind while you GM this 
campaign.
PAINT THE WORLD IN CONTRAST
Subvert expectations by giving space for the nightmarish to 
charm and the beautiful to terrify. Give the PCs visions of the 
natural beauty of Fanewick that has run roughshod across 
the region, breaking the bounds of the bogs and forests and 
devastating homes and communities. Show the grim and 
ordered life behind Havenâs walls, but also show the culture, 
art, and progress that has come out of centuries of safety. 
Contrast the capricious nature of the Faint Divinities with 
the devotion of the Wicklings and Havenites fighting to save 
their home. In a place of long nights and days, dual seasons, 
and two nations in conflict, look for ways to highlight bold 
dualities.
SHOW THEM TRUE DANGER
Though it may be tragic, bodily harm is not the worst tragedy 
that can befall the characters. T o illustrate whatâs truly at 
stake, use the PCsâ origins in Fanewick or Haven to show them 
what they stand to lose, be it their homes, family, friends, 
communities, or even their core truths and beliefs. The events 
of this campaign may change, threaten, or destroy these 
aspects of their pastâwhen your players create and are 
invested in their characterâs backstory, they have something 
to fight for.
OFFER ALTERNATIVES TO VIOLENCE
By illuminating nonviolent approaches to problem-solving, the 
PCs can help break the brutal cycle that binds this world. For 
example, showing compassionârather than swordpointâ
to a corrupted beast can free them from the Witherwild. 
Similarly, the conflict between Haven and Fanewick shouldnât 
only be solved with blood and blade. What threatens both 
could also unify them. Give the PCs opportunities to mend old 
wounds, right past wrongs, and heal the rift between Haven 
and Fanewick from within.
CREATE MULTIDIMENSIONAL ALLIES AND 
ADVERSARIES
No adversary or ally is all good or all bad, and they each have 
multidimensional lives. Even the most congenial ally should 
be hiding darkness inside them, hoping their failings will go 
undiscovered. Those painted as evil should sometimes do the 
right thing, even if itâs for the wrong reason. Just because a 
PC or NPC is from Haven doesnât make them a villain, and, 
conversely, not all the inhabitants of Fanewick are virtuous. 
Finding the nuance, complications, and deeper motivations 
of the people of Haven and Fanewick will lead to richer 
interactions, more complex moral choices, and a deeper sense 
of attachment to the world for the players.

DISTINCTIONS
Use this information to prepare your campaign. You can also 
share it with your players as needed.
THE WEEKS OF DAY AND NIGHT
The day and night cycle occurs weekly, meaning the sun rises 
for an entire week before setting into a nighttime of the same 
length. This has an impact on everything from agriculture to 
trade, as many merchants refuse to travel through the night. 
But this cycle doesnât just affect Wicklings, itâs dictated how 
Fanewickâs wondrous ecology has evolved. Days and nights 
are accompanied by entirely different natural soundscapes 
as Fanewickâs nocturnal denizens sleep through the long days 
and stalk the woods in times of darkness while their diurnal 
counterparts sleep. The plants similarly live on this strange 
day-night loop, and many live out their entire life cycles in a 
week. Sun rose vines make a thorny ascent to the top of the 
tree canopy over the course of the week, only to wilt under the 
light of the moon. Conversely, night bloom, a bioluminescent 
flower that emits the smell of burnt sugar and decay, 
only blossoms when evening falls, illuminating patches of 
forestâa godsend to anyone forced to travel in the dark.
THE SERPENTâS SICKNESS
The plague sweeping across Haven spares no one. Since 
the initial outbreak, Haven officials have worked tirelessly to 
quarantine those in the early stages of the disease, but this 
effort has done little to stop its spread. Due to the rarity of 
crimson ladyâs veil, many citizens began to carry or consume 
all manner of flowers and snake sheddings in an attempt to 
protect or cure themselves. 
In the initial stages, victims are afflicted with a hacking cough 
laden with dust that resembles powdered bone. Then a scaled 
rash erupts across their skin, cracking their flesh in a unique 
and painful pattern that resembles a snakeâs skin. Not long 
after, the victimsâ bodies harden until their organs solidify and 
cease to function. The final stages of the Serpentâs Sickness is 
so quick that many transform into statues where they stand, 
leaving all of Haven a cenotaph to a once-great power.
LADYâS VEIL
These small flowers grow in patches of sun throughout 
Fanewick. For every ten thousand blossoms of white-petaled 
flowers, one blooms a unique and vibrant red. These flowers 
have long been used in herbal teas across the region, with the 
crimson flowers holding a place in specific ceremonies. Even 
so, they were only foraged until the Havenites discovered 
crimson ladyâs veilâthe only known cure for Serpentâs 
Sickness. 
Thus, the Haven Army invaded Fanewick and began cultivating 
the flowers on massive farms that have overtaken the regionâs 
bogs. Though the theft of the Reaping Eye has created an 
indefinite growing season, the red flowers remain just as rare, 
and Fanewick is permeated by a sickly sweet smell as the 
Haven Army races to mass-produce a cure for the Serpentâs 
Sickness. THE WITHERWILD
This corruption, empowered by the endless spring, is 
spreading throughout Fanewick. Some believe the overgrowth 
began in the forest, while others claim it sprang from the 
bogs. But no matter its origins, this flourishing malignancy 
induces horrific changes and massive growth on anything 
it touches, transforming them into Withered beings. Plants 
spring to life with a desire to consume all around them. 
Animals grow to immense proportions, with onerous 
dispositions to match their exaggerated teeth, tusks, and 
claws. Even harmless creatures that were once hunted for 
food have become dangerous and formidable adversaries. 
When a person is corrupted by the Witherwild, either from 
a purposeful attack or accidental harm (see the upcoming 
âCorruption from the Witherwildâ section), they are 
transformed. They become a nightmarish hybridâtheir body 
warped and intertwined with plant or beast. The Witherwild 
slowly replaces the personality of its victims with the same 
drive to consume exhibited by the rest of the corrupted 
Fanewick. Though the Withered may retain a semblance of 
who they are for a time, they eventually face the final loss of 
their personhood. Some Wicklings believe the Withered are 
gifted this power by Niktaâs wrath to drive the forces of Haven 
from Fanewick and return the Shepherdâs Reaping Eye.
THE GODS OF FANEWICK
Gods in this land arenât ethereal concepts that exist in another 
realm; instead, they wander the land as incarnate beings, 
residing in both the natural world as well as within homes and 
small villages. As such, theyâre generally present in Wicklingsâ 
lives. Many communities, and some larger families, even have 
their own small god or tutelary spirit who watches over them. 
Belief and worship take on a different meaning in Fanewickâ
there is a constant push and pull between the goals of people 
and their deific neighbors. The gods must curry worship from 
mortals, often by performing small miracles, acts of service, 
or by testing their resolve with tricks and curses. Mortals 
rely on the small blessings from the gods to keep them safe 
when traveling and working in Fanewick. The most powerful 
and widely acknowledged Faint Divinity is the Shepherd of 
Seasons, Nikta, as the loss of her eye had the most recent and 
visible impact on everyone in Fanewick.
Fanewickâs various divinities each have their own opinion 
concerning the Witherwild corruption. While some enjoy 
natureâs newfound dominance, many of the lesser deities are 
wary of how out of balance Fanewick has become. While their 
behavior and motives may be inscrutable, these deities are 
more accessible than gods who watch from on high. 
Fulg, Stacker of Stones: A small god who favors tribute in 
the form of smooth, stacked river rocks. Under his power, 
bivalves and limpets grow abundantly on rocks where they 
can be easily harvested. He is largely uninformed about the 
problems Fanewick faces, and he prefers it that way.
Hyacynis, They Who Spread Small Blossoms: A friend of 
bees and tiny flowers who has embraced the Witherwild 
after seeing their influence and domain swell (literally) 
to immense proportions. Theyâre enjoying this rampant 
growth and do not see a reason to end it.

Ikla, the Sky Painter: Iklaâs artistic prowess and talent are 
unmatched, painting the skies of each weekly sunrise and 
sunset over Fanewick in a myriad of scintillating colors. 
They could not be lazier the rest of the week, and their 
demeanor is exceedingly unpleasant, offended that anyone 
would ask a favor of them during their time off.
Oove, the Watcher of the Night Bloom: He is one of the 
few local gods who has never been seen, but he is often 
heard in the wilds at night, whispering directions to lost 
travelers, pointing them to the nearest source of night 
bloom. Locals claim he leads those who displease him 
or harm nocturnal creatures into dangerous terrain. Itâs 
rumored that he watches over Fanewick nights from his 
home on the moon.
QuiâGar, Whispered Sweetness for a Thorny End: A quiet 
god who presides over the deaths of those who pass in 
thorny bushes and briar patches. Traditionally, she doesnât 
receive many visitors, but the Witherwildâs corruptive 
growth has made her job harder and upended her quiet 
existence.
Rohkin, the Wandering Horn: Rohkin watches over the 
many herds of horned creatures that reside in Fanewick. 
In happier times, he preserved the balance of nature 
and civilization, preventing overhunting. But since the 
corruption of the Witherwild has taken hold, heâs seen his 
herds change into unrecognizable, dangerous beasts.
These are but a small slice of the hundreds, if not thousands, 
of Faint Divinities lurking, relaxing, hunting, and playing 
throughout Fanewick.  
What Faint Divinities do the PCs acknowledge and pay 
tribute to, if any?
How has the Witherwild changed the outlook, personality, 
and dispositions of the Faint Divinities the characters 
encounter?
Which gods ally themselves with Haven to preserve the 
endless spring? Which align with Fanewick?
THE INCITING INCIDENT
You can use the prompt below to start your campaign, or create 
your own.
The Reaping Eye is stowed in a secure vault beneath the 
central tower of Havenâs wizarding school, seemingly 
impossible to recover. A secretive and dangerous rebel group, 
led by a mysterious figure known only as the Fanewraith (she/
her), has hatched a plan to end the curse of the Witherwild: 
find the Great Owl, Nikta, and pluck out the Sowing Eye. 
While this may solve the immediate problem, the long-term 
consequences are not being considered, just as they werenât 
when Haven invaded. 
Havenâs beleaguered spymaster, Kreil Dirn (he/him), is not 
a popular person in Haven. He is responsible for rooting out 
insurgents, stopping schemes before they have a chance to 
start, and keeping a close watch on Havenâs internal activities. 
Kreil has never agreedâat least not openlyâwith Archmage Phylaxâs (they/them) decision to steal the Reaping Eye, and 
the consequences theyâve all paid for that decision have been 
grimly vindicating. 
Recently, Kreil uncovered the Fanewraithâs plot and is horrified 
by the possibility of her success. Knowing he canât send a 
troop of Haven soldiers deep into the woods to hunt down and 
stop the Fanewraith from stealing the Sowing Eye, Kreil uses 
his vast network of informants and spies to find a group of 
adventurers who can bring the Fanewraith to swift justice.
The party is sent an invitation from Haven to meet with 
Kreil. But is his information correct? Does he have his own 
motivation or secret ambition? Whether they come from 
Fanewick or Haven, the party must extend some trust to a 
person who is equally as dangerous and mercurial as the 
âenemyâ they pursue. And what will they do when they find the 
Fanewraith? Bring her to justice? Side with her? Attempt to 
recover the Reaping Eye?
Kreil advises the party to start their hunt for the Fanewraith 
in the treetop village of Alula, where he suspects she runs her 
operation.
CAMPAIGN MECHANICS
The following mechanics are unique to this campaign.
CORRUPTION FROM THE WITHERWILD
Adversaries and environments in this campaign can gain 
an additional type called Withered. When an adversary is 
Withered, describe how the Witherwild changed or impacted 
how they would normally appear or operate. You also need 
about 20 Wither tokens (these can be the same as the tokens 
you use for Fear). 
Any time a PC takes Severe damage from a Withered 
adversary or environment, gain a Wither token and place it 
on that PCâs character sheet. When you do, the PC must roll 
their Fear Die. If they roll equal to or below the number of 
Wither tokens on their sheet, they immediately gain a scar and 
clear all tokens, describing how the Witherwild changes them 
permanently.
At the end of each session, clear all Wither tokens from the 
PCsâ sheets and gain an equal amount of Fear. If a character 
ever dies with Wither tokens on their sheet, their body is 
permanently taken over by the Witherwild. 
SESSION ZERO QUESTIONS
Ask any of these questions to your players, or make your own.
What dangerous animal comes out during the week of night 
that isnât out during the week of day?
What unique trait (such as appearance, smell, or taste) 
does anything tainted by the Witherwild have? 
What superstitions does your character or their community 
have about traversing Fanewick during the long nights?
Your character has witnessed something beautiful that 
came from the Witherwild. What is it and how has it 
transformed their view of the corruption?

## Step 1: Choose Your Class
Every character starts by selecting a class, which determines their core abilities and role in the party.

### Available Classes:

### Class Features
Each class begins with unique class features that define their capabilities. These are provided on the class character sheet.

## Step 2: Choose Your Heritage
Heritage includes both ancestry and community.

### Choose Your Ancestry
Select one ancestry that reflects your character's lineage:

**Available Ancestries:**
- Clank, Drakona, Dwarf, Elf, Faerie, Faun
- Firbolg, Fungril, Galapa, Giant, Goblin, Halfling

Each ancestry provides two unique features that impact your character's abilities.

### Choose Your Community
Select a community that reflects where your character grew up:

**Available Communities:**
- Highborne, Loreborne, Orderborne, Ridgeborne
- Seaborne, Slyborne, Underborne, Wanderborne, Wildborne

Each community provides a feature you can utilize during the game.

## Step 3: Assign Character Traits
Distribute trait modifiers across the six core stats:

### The Six Traits:
- **Agility**: Sprint, Leap, Maneuver

- **Presence**: Charm, Perform, Deceive
- **Knowledge**: Recall, Analyze, Comprehend

### Starting Modifiers
Distribute these modifiers in any order: **+2, +1, +1, 0, 0, -1**

Consider your weapon choice, spellcasting needs, and desired playstyle when assigning modifiers.

## Step 4: Record Additional Information

### Evasion
Your class determines your starting Evasion value. This represents how hard it is for enemies to hit you.

### Hit Points and Stress
- **Hit Points**: Physical health and endurance (varies by class)
- **Stress**: Mental/emotional strain (all classes start with 6)

### Hope and Fear
- **Hope**: Start with 2 Hope
- **Hope Die**: Higher result = success, gain Hope (max 6)
- **Fear Die**: Higher result = GM gains Fear for complications

## Step 5: Choose Starting Equipment

### Weapons
Choose either:
- One two-handed primary weapon, OR
- One one-handed primary weapon + one one-handed secondary weapon

All starting weapons are Tier 1. Record your Proficiency (starts at 1).

### Armor
Choose one set of Tier 1 armor. Record:
- Base Score (armor's base value)
- Damage Thresholds (base + character level)
- Armor Slots (equal to Armor Score)

### Other Starting Items
Every character starts with:
- Torch
- 50 feet of rope
- Basic supplies (tent, bedroll, tinderbox, rations)
- A handful of gold
- Choice of Minor Health Potion (clear 1d4 HP) or Minor Stamina Potion (clear 1d4 Stress)
- Class-specific additional items

## Step 6: Create Your Background
Answer background questions from your character guide to develop your character's history, motivations, and connections to the world.

## Step 7: Create Your Experiences
Experiences are core ways to express your character's backstory and expertise. Choose experiences that reflect your character's past and help define their role in the party.

## Starting Level
All characters begin at Level 1. Record your level and update it when you level up.

## Languages
Daggerheart assumes everyone speaks a common language and that sign language is widely understood. Regional languages can be added with GM approval.

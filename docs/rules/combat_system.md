# Combat System - Daggerheart

## Combat Flow
Combat in Daggerheart is malleable and driven by dice. Player characters pass the spotlight between themselves, making moves until someone fails a roll or rolls with Fear, or until the GM spends a Fear to interrupt the players' turns.

## Attack Rolls
When you make an attack roll, roll your Duality Dice + relevant trait modifier against the target's Evasion. If you succeed, make a damage roll to determine how much damage the target takes.

### Unarmed Attack Rolls
When making an attack without a weapon (punch, kick), use Strength or Finesse trait. On success, deal d4 physical damage using your Proficiency.

### Spellcast Rolls
Spellcast Rolls are action rolls used when creating significant magical effects. You must have a Spellcast trait from your subclass. Use your Spellcast trait modifier for the roll.

## Damage Rolls
When you succeed on an attack roll, make a damage roll to determine damage dealt.

### Proficiency
Your Proficiency reflects weapon skill. Start at 1, maximum 6. Determines how many damage dice you roll on successful attacks.

### Damage Dice
Roll a number of your weapon's damage dice equal to your Proficiency. Add any modifiers to the total.

### Critical Successes and Damage
If your attack roll critically succeeds (both dice show same number), start with the highest possible value of your damage dice, then make a normal damage roll and add it to that value.

## Damage Types
- **Physical (phy)**: Mundane physical blows, blades, bows
- **Magic (mag)**: Magical means, harmful spells
- **Direct Damage**: Cannot be reduced by Armor Slots

## Resistance and Immunity
- **Resistance**: Halve damage of that type before comparing to damage thresholds
- **Immunity**: Take no damage from attacks of that type
- Multiple sources of same resistance don't stack

## Reaction Rolls
Reaction rolls are made in response to attacks or hazards. Work like action rolls but don't generate Hope, Fear, or GM moves. Other characters can't help on reaction rolls.

### Critical Success on Reaction Rolls
You ignore any effects that would still impact you on a success (such as taking damage or marking Stress).

## Advantage and Disadvantage
- **Advantage**: Add a d6 advantage die to your total
- **Disadvantage**: Subtract a d6 disadvantage die from your total
- Advantage and disadvantage cancel each other out
- Multiple sources of advantage/disadvantage don't stack beyond one die

## Combat Actions
When spotlighted, an adversary can:
- Move within Close range and make a standard attack
- Move within Close range and use an adversary action
- Clear a condition
- Sprint within Far or Very Far range

## Group Action Rolls
When multiple characters act together:
- Nominate one character to lead the action
- Each other player makes a reaction roll using appropriate traits
- Leader's action roll gains +1 for each successful reaction roll, -1 for each failed one

## Tag Team Rolls
Once per session, spend 3 Hope to initiate a Tag Team Roll with another PC:
- Both make separate action rolls
- Choose one roll to apply for both results
- On Hope roll: all PCs involved gain Hope
- On Fear roll: GM gains Fear for each PC involved
- On successful Tag Team attack: both roll damage and add totals together

## Conditions
Common combat conditions include:
- **Stunned**: Cannot take actions, disadvantage on all rolls
- **Prone**: Disadvantage on attack rolls, advantage on attacks against you
- **Grappled**: Cannot move, disadvantage on most actions
- **Frightened**: Disadvantage on rolls while source of fear is visible
- **Vulnerable**: Advantage on attacks against you
- **Poisoned**: Take direct damage each time you act

## Death and Recovery
When HP reaches 0, character is unconscious. Recovery rules depend on campaign and GM discretion.
